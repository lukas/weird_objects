# Autonomous experiment orchestrator

A self-driving loop that keeps the CoreWeave RL campaign running while
the operator is away. Mechanical software owns state and throughput;
an LLM cycle owns judgment (verdicts + what to try next). If this file
and the code disagree, the code is right — fix this file.

**Taking over this project (human or LLM)? Start with
`rl_docs/AGENT.md`** — how the agent picks runs, what we learned
works/fails, and the future-work map. This file covers mechanics only.

## Architecture (2026-08-09)

```
controller pod (hexapod-sweep-friction, tmux session "orchestrator")
  watch_loop.py — polls W&B every 5 min, plus three background workers:
    • backlog worker: every 2 min, `launch_run.py drain` pushes queued
      specs from backlog.json onto free GPU pods (self-repairing:
      syncs code, pushes checkpoints + W&B secret, retries 3x, then
      parks in backlog_failed.json)
    • checkup worker: ~5 min after each launch, `launch_run.py
      checkup`; DEAD/SUSPECT findings are injected into the next cycle
    • pre-stager: for each newly finished run, pulls the checkpoint,
      starts the DR-0 gate eval, caches W&B data
  when runs FINISH → spawns a decision cycle (cap 2, concurrent):
    claude -p --bare --model claude-fable-5 <ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md>
    the cycle TRIAGES each finished run (~10 min: video, curves,
    gate scalars), records verdicts via `launch_run.py update`
    (auto-renders rl_docs/runs/<run>.md) + `ops.sh wandbnote`,
    digs in only on a real trigger, and refills the pipeline by
    queueing specs into the backlog. Logs: /workspace/cycle_logs/
```

Training pods: `hexapod-mjx-train-0..15` (1 H200 + 24 cores each; see
`CAPACITY.md`, live truth via `capacity.py`). New pods are initialized
by `bootstrap_train_pod.sh`, which writes the `.bootstrapped` marker
the drain requires before treating a pod as a slot.

## State — machines own facts, the LLM owns interpretation

- `experiments.json` — the ledger, single source of truth per run
  (status, hypothesis, gate, verdict, W&B id). Edit ONLY via
  `launch_run.py update`. Every update regenerates the browsable
  per-run summary in `rl_docs/runs/`.
- `backlog.json` — mechanical launch queue, fed by cycles/operator
  (`launch_run.py backlog add`), drained automatically.
- `RL_LOG.md` — 1 line per cycle; `RL_PLAN.md` — the plan (~120
  lines). Everything else: `rl_docs/` (start at its README).
- Code provenance: `snapshot.sh` commits/tags/pushes, `--sync` stamps
  pods with `.code_sha`; the launcher refuses mismatched pods.

## Operating it

- **Everything routine**: see `rl_docs/COMMANDS.md` (ops.sh helpers,
  gotchas, which command answers which question).
- **Pause cycles:** `touch PAUSE` in this directory on the controller
  (training keeps going). Unpause: remove the file.
- **Kick a session now:** `ops.sh cycle ["focus text"]` (works from the
  operator Mac) writes `KICK` here; the watcher spawns one deep-model
  session on its next poll (≤5 min), allowed one slot past the
  concurrency cap (temporary 5th session), counted in the daily budget.
- **Restart the watcher:** ONLY via `restart_watcher.sh` (nohup'd on
  the controller). Hard-killing the tmux session murders in-flight
  cycles, which only write their output at exit.
- **Logs:** `/workspace/orchestrator.log` (watcher),
  `/workspace/cycle_logs/` (cycles), `/tmp/train_<run>.log` (on pods).

## Safety

`guardrails.yaml` binds every cycle: sim/pods only, never the physical
robot, caps on concurrent runs / steps / cycles per day. The workspace
hardware-safety rules travel with the repo (AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/).
