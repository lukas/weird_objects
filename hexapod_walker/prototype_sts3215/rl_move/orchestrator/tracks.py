"""Research-track registry.

The campaign's active tracks live in tracks.json. All W&B-backed runs
share ONE project (tags, not separate projects); each run is tagged
`track:<id>`. tracks.json is the single source of truth; this module
is the one shared accessor.

Containment rule: agent-initiated follow-ups go only to registered
tracks. Operator-launched out-of-scope runs are triaged honestly but
never spawn agent follow-ups.
