  # Code-version marker (2026-08-09): pods have no git, so the launcher
  # cannot ask them what code they run. Stale code on long5m silently
  # dropped cw-walk-lowent-dr03's --cfg-set reward package (the old
  # walk_task.py never read those keys) and trained 4M steps on the
  # wrong reward. Record what was synced; launch_run.py refuses to
  # launch when this marker is missing or != local HEAD. A dirty tree
  # gets a -dirty suffix, which the launcher also refuses — snapshot
  # (commit) BEFORE syncing, as the cycle protocol already requires.
  SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
  # Dirty check EXCLUDES the orchestrator's runtime state files
  # (ledger, backlog + parked items, lock files): the watcher rewrites
  # them every few minutes, so including them made the tree perpetually
  # "dirty" and the -dirty marker refused every drain launch while 9
  # GPUs idled (2026-08-09). They are operational state, not trainer
  # code — the marker exists to pin the CODE the pod runs.
  # ... and EXCLUDES markdown docs: cycles append to RL_LOG.md / RL_PLAN.md
  # between commits, and an uncommitted doc edit was re-blocking every
  # drain launch an hour after the state-file fix (2026-08-09). Docs are
  # not trainer code either.
  # ... and EXCLUDES eval/train artifacts + atomic-write temp files:
  # untracked logs/, checkpoint zips and ledger .tmp files from
  # concurrent cycles kept stamping transient -dirty markers that cost
  # a drain attempt each (cycle 54, 08-09).
