"""SimHexapodJointWalkEnv — velocity-command locomotion, raw joint actions.

The most ambitious task so far: a ``walk`` goal mode where the policy is
given a commanded planar body velocity (body-frame vx/vy, m/s) and must
discover a gait that tracks it. Built on the raw joint-space env because
the fixed-foot IK cannot express stepping at all — the same structural
ceiling that blocked flat rise blocked locomotion outright.

Goal obs grows by 2 (scaled vx/vy refs, zero for non-walk modes), so
obs = 59 proprio + 11 goal = 70. All other modes (hold/lean/track/
unload/raise/rise/lower) remain in the mix so the policy keeps its
balance/rise competence while learning to walk.

Reward for walk episodes: the shared kernel/regularizer stack (zero tilt
refs — stay level while moving) PLUS a Gaussian kernel on velocity
tracking error, same design language as the tilt/height kernels:
``k_walk * exp(-|v - v_ref|^2 / 2 sigma^2)``. Velocity is the chassis'
body-frame planar velocity from privileged sim state; hardware transfer
will need an estimator (or optical flow), which is acknowledged and
deferred — sim-first, like everything else in Phase 1.

v2 (post cw-walk, which plateaued at a ~0.04 m/s shuffle):

1. MEASURED body velocity appended to the obs (2 dims, obs 70 -> 72).
   v1 was open-loop on the exact quantity it was scored on — the policy
   could never correct speed error it cannot sense.
2. PROGRESS reward: k_prog * (v . u_ref)/s_ref, capped at 1.25. The
   kernel alone pays ~nothing until tracking is already close (sigma
   0.04 at 0.075 m/s error = 0.17), so "stand still and collect the
   level-body kernel" was a local optimum. The linear term pays every
   cm/s in the commanded direction from the very first step, and
   charges moving against it.
3. Walk mix 0.40 -> 0.70; kernel sigma widened to 0.05.
