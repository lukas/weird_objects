"""Full-robot BuildViz scene built from the VERIFIED standing-pose parts.

History: the original scene drew the coxa / femur / tibia as plain
cylinders and dressed each joint with generic test-fit housing/yoke
meshes.  Those proxies visually clipped each other (the straight coxa
cylinder ran through the hip hardware) even though the real printed parts
clear it.

This version instead reuses the EXACT placement the verifier checks for
self-collision -- ``_verify_prototype._build_standing_leg`` (the real
``make_coxa_link`` / ``make_femur_link`` / ``make_tibia_link`` meshes) and
``_verify_prototype._place_servo_bodies`` (the three STS3215 servo
envelopes in their cradles).  That configuration passes
``check_self_collision`` (6.8 mm^3) and ``check_servo_clearance`` (<=165
mm^3), so the viewer now shows a geometry that is provably free of
unexpected pass-throughs.

The verifier builds only leg 0 (apothem direction a = pi/6).  The six legs
are rotationally symmetric about the chassis Z axis, so legs 1-5 are leg 0
rotated by i*60 deg.  Body parts (chassis plates, battery holder,
electronics tray) are placed exactly as ``make_assembly_preview`` does.

Motion is now baked into this ONE scene: the additive BuildViz ``joints[]`` +
``poses[]`` + ``animations[]`` blocks (per-joint sliders, clickable poses, a
looping tripod-walk clip) live directly in ``full_robot_viz/scene.json`` -- there
is no longer a separate ``scene_motion.json`` file or a distinct
``prototype_sts3215_motion`` build id.  Generating the motion blocks is
essentially free (~0.01 s of joint/pose math on the ALREADY-placed meshes vs the
~4 s STL rebuild), so motion is ALWAYS generated.  The only expensive motion step
is the swept self-overlap check (``buildviz sweep`` ~13 s), which is therefore
OPT-IN on push (see the Makefile ``SWEEP=1``), while the cheap manifest
validation runs every push.

Run:
    ./run.sh hexapod_walker/prototype_sts3215/tools/full_robot_viz_build.py

Then PUBLISH into the ONE machine-wide BuildViz hub (default port 5183) and view
it there -- never start a per-project dev server on 5173/etc:
    make -C hexapod_walker/prototype_sts3215 verify-buildviz   # buildviz push --bump
    open http://127.0.0.1:5183/?build=prototype_sts3215

# / FEMUR 90 / TIBIA 128 mm; only joint/segment CONSTRUCTION changes.  Joint
# architecture: YAW = cantilevered (coxa 25 mm < ~50 mm rule, no passive
# bearing); HIP + KNEE = bearing sandwich (driven Ø20 25T disc horn on one side,
# 688 passive bearing on the other).  When you add/rename a partType in PALETTE,
# add its rationale here too — a missing key makes the build non-compat.
DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "coxa_link": "ONE-PIECE printed coxa (Aug 2026 merge of the old coxa_yaw_hub + coxa_hip_bracket): the yaw turntable hub (bolts the driven Ø20 disc horn on the Ø14 / 4x M3 circle, rides the touching 6805 pair (25x37x7, Aug 2026 thick-section swap) on a Ø25.15 press-fit boss) fused to the hip servo cradle. Aug 17 2026 sink pass: the cradle rides 5 mm lower -- its foot slab fuses through the full platform band and the hip-servo well floor sits 2 mm over the platform top (+26), so the 5 vertical head-access shafts are only ~5.3 mm deep above the M3x30 horn-screw heads (any driver fits) and the part is 5 mm shorter. Aug 17 2026 scrape fix: the running gaps between the rotating link and the stationary yaw_bearing_cap widened to 1.5 mm axial (platform underside over the cap rim) and 1.0 mm radial (dust-skirt bore over the Phi 44 ring) after the printed parts scraped. The horn-screw seats are 1.25 mm deeper (bench: printed seats + screw tolerance ate ~1 mm of horn bite; corner tips now just break the disc's far face, the centre seat goes 1 mm deeper into the spline tap). Aug 16 2026 flatten: the cradle's 4x M2.5 end-face bolt holes and the DS3225-era wire-exit corridor are deleted -- a clean 4-wall box. Aug 17 2026: the cradle grew the SAME rear retention tab as the femur knee cradle (user: 'copy that same part ... so I can screw into the servo from both sides') -- a vertical 5.5 mm plate on the back-face side taking 2x M2.5x6 self-tappers into the hip servo's rear molded hole pair nearer the inboard/wire end, heads flush in Phi 5.2 x 2 mm recesses (connector-end pair stays open for the bus harness; the swinging femur arm passes ~1.5 mm over the tab's outer face).",

Aug 2026: a rear tab under the knee servo's open back face takes 2× M2.5×6 self-tappers into the rear molded hole pair nearer the spar (the connector-end pair stays open for the bus harness; the tab reaches 4.5 mm past the servo's wire-end face — Aug 17 2026 bench remeasure: the flat back-face ledge before the ~1.8 mm case step is just under 5 mm, not the ~4 mm read off the photo, so the 1 mm-longer tab now fully encloses both screw holes instead of the old open keyhole slots — its wall riser is capped 3.5 mm above the servo base for the wire-end shell flare, and the heads sit FLUSH in Ø5.2 × 2 mm recesses like the output plate's 4 countersunk case screws: the tab is 5.5 mm thick = 3.5 shank + 2 head pocket, keeping the M2.5×6's pilot bite unchanged), and the knee well's far (+X) wall is one flat solid face: full-width buttress thickness, no DS3225-era wire channel (the knee cables leave via the back-face ports through the open back).

# LOCAL-FRAME part producers (so BuildViz reports CAD-local coordinates)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# BuildViz's pick read-out shows ``local XYZ`` via ``mesh.worldToLocal`` -- the
# inverse of each instance's ``transform``.  If we bake the world placement into
# the STL and ship an identity transform (the old behaviour), that read-out
# equals WORLD mm, which does NOT match any single part's design frame and made
# it painful to talk to an LLM about feature positions.
#
# Instead every producer below returns ``(name, local_mesh, M0)`` where:
#   * ``local_mesh`` is the RAW ``make_*()`` part in its OWN design frame -- the
#     identical frame as ``stl_prototype/<part>.stl`` and the ``make_*`` source
#     code -- so picking a point reports coordinates an LLM can act on directly.
#   * ``M0`` is the 4x4 that maps that local frame into the leg-0 world frame
#     (apothem a=pi/6), BEFORE the per-leg yaw rotation and standing-pose lift
#     (both applied in ``main`` and folded into the per-instance ``transform``).
# World placement is ``M0 @ local`` and reproduces EXACTLY the poses the
# verifier checks (asserted in ``main`` against ``_verify_prototype``).

# Multiple instances share one identical local STL (all six legs print the same
# coxa hub; every servo well holds the same body envelope; etc).  This map
# collapses those onto a single exported mesh; unlisted names key on themselves.

# These blocks are ALWAYS baked into the single ``scene.json`` (mirroring the
# prototype_v1 ``hexapod-prototype`` build): generating them is essentially free
# (joint/pose math on the already-placed meshes), so there is no reason to gate
# GENERATION or split them into a second build.  Only the swept self-overlap
# VALIDATION (``buildviz sweep``) is expensive and is opt-in on push.
#
# BuildViz drives motion from three OPTIONAL top-level scene keys (see
# /Users/lbiewald/buildviz BUILDVIZ_INTEGRATION.md "Motion / kinematics" and
# src/buildvizKinematics.ts).  Old viewers ignore them; a viewer that
# understands them gets per-joint sliders, an "Animate sweep" button (each DOF
# swept min->max->min), clickable named poses, and a play/scrub timeline for the
# keyframed ``animations[]`` clip, plus swept-pose overlap validation.  The
# forward-kinematics the viewer computes is EXACTLY:
#
#   L(joint, v) = T(origin) * R(axis, v-home) * T(-origin)     [revolute, deg]
#   C(j)        = C(parent) * L(j)                             [chain compose]
#   world(inst) = C(j) * inst.transform                       [home = static]
#
# so ``axis``/``origin`` are in the SCENE (world home) frame and a joint's
# ``instances`` list holds ONLY its own distal link (ancestors live on the
# parent joints).  The static scene IS the home pose (every joint value 0), so
# we can reuse the verified standing-pose ``transform``s untouched and only emit
# the joint axes/pivots + which instances each joint carries.
#
# The yaw/hip/knee axes and pivots below are derived from the SAME authoritative
# leg-0 kinematic chain ``_leg0_local_link_parts`` / ``_servo_local_parts`` use
# (apothem direction a=pi/6; the static ``T_coxa``/``T_femur``/``T_tibia``
# placement), then mapped into each leg's world frame by the per-leg yaw
# rotation + standing-pose lift -- so the rotation a slider applies lands on the
# real joint axis through the real pivot, not a centroid guess.

#                 servo's body rides the coxa; its output drives the femur).
#   * hip  link = femur sandwich + hip horns + the knee servo BODY on the femur.

#   * TAIL (data entry, S+GND only): data Wago at the drop slot -> STRAIGHT
#     DOWN through the yaw retainer window (below the hanging body) -> yaw
#     BACK ports.
#   * yaw -> hip (S+GND+V+): yaw BACK ports -> under the case, out the
#     saddle's OPEN +X end -> up past the bearing cap between its ear
#     lugs -> hip BACK ports.
#   * POWER TEE (V+/GND): corner power-Wago branch at the drop slot ->
#     same climb corridor -> hip BACK ports (offset to ride beside the
#     data ribbon).
#   * hip -> knee (S+GND+V+): both port clusters face INBOARD on the same
