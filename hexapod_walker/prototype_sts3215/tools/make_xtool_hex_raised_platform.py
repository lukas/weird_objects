"""Raised hex platform: thin top hex + legs that land on the 110 mm plate.

Aug 2026 (user: another hexagonal platform 42 mm above the small hexagon,
thin hexagon with 42 mm legs out of each side, feet within the lower hex
radius so they can attach to it).

Aug 2026 follow-up (user: move supports to the corners, very close to
the corner): legs sit on the six VERTEX rays instead of flat midpoints.

Aug 2026 screen stand (user: longer legs + wire slot on the thin/short
side of a 63×35 mm panel): also emits
``hex_raised_platform_110_h28_screen.stl`` (legs ``hp.HEX_RAISED_LEG_H``,
wire slot only — no screen window; panel sits centered on the solid top).

Aug 2026 follow-up: +10 mm height (62→72), legs 2× thick, top face
perfectly flat (legs stop flush with top), wire slot tucked under the
screen's +X short edge so its Y span matches the screen (35 mm) and
wires drop behind the panel.

Aug 2026 round-plate rework (user: make the mount plate circular to match
the chassis_top disc below, keep the holes): the LOWER plate is now a
ROUND Ø115 disc (= ``hp.HEX_MOUNT_PLATE_DIAM``, same as chassis_top),
plus two Ø8 wire ports for the underside 3.3 V Wago feed/branches
(``hp.MOUNT_PLATE_WIRE_PORT_XY``) and two pairs of zip-tie slots on the
E/W rim for dressing the wires that cross the magnet interface.

Late-Aug 2026 design review:
  * The legacy 49.5 mm bolt square (``hp.ELEC_CHASSIS_MOUNT_HOLES_XY``,
    the pre-standoff chassis generation) is DROPPED -- only the live
    +/-31.1 standoff/magnet-post square remains.
  * Magnet SHEAR REGISTRATION: four printed bosses on the plate
    UNDERSIDE (washer-shaped, OD ``REG_BOSS_OD``, bore ``REG_BORE_D``,
    ``REG_BOSS_H`` tall) socket the top 2 mm of each Ø8 post magnet, so
    the magnets only carry pull and every gait cycle's sideways shake
    goes into the boss walls instead of sliding the deck.  The plate
    still seats directly on the magnet top faces -- stack height is
    unchanged.
  * Screen-stand legs dropped 72 -> 28 mm (the 72 mm tower put the
    robot's highest mass on a magnet-held 2 mm plate).  Leg height
    single source: ``hp.HEX_RAISED_LEG_H``.

Late-Aug 2026 review, round 2 (this file's current form):
  * The stand TOP is a ROUND Ø115 disc matching the plate and
    chassis_top discs below (was a 110 hex -- the "hex" in the file /
    part names is historical now, kept so the loader + viz partType
    stay stable).
  * THREE legs at az 90/210/330 (was 6): a 20 g screen does not need
    six; the south rim (wire ports + underside 3.3 V Wago) stays clear
    of feet.  Each foot carries a Φ2.5 BLIND SELF-TAP PILOT rising into
    the leg blade, and the stand mounts with 3x M3x8 SHCS (the same
    91290A113 stock as the clamp caps) driven UP from under the plate
    -- this CLOSES the old spec gap where 6 M3 went through clearance
    holes into nothing (6 unlisted nuts).
  * The plate gains the Arduino-UNO mounting pattern for the Uno Q at
    the as-built ``hp.UNO_Q_ON_HEX_CENTRE`` = (0, -12): THREE of the
    four standard holes (the SE hole would land ~1.5 mm from the SE
    registration boss, so it is dropped -- three-point mount, M3x8 down
    through the board + plate into an M3 thumb nut below, same thumb
    nut stock as the magnet posts).  This folds the one useful feature
    of the retired ``make_hex_uno_q_io_board.py`` into the live plate.
  * RETIRED outputs: the 42 mm base platform variant (nothing as-built
    used it), the ``hex_uno_q_io_board_110`` board, and the plate's SVG
    cut file (the underside registration bosses cannot be laser-cut;
    shipping a boss-less cut file was a footgun).

Geometry
--------
  * Lower plate: ROUND Ø115 disc, 2 mm thick, matching the chassis_top
    disc below.  Coxa-sweep keep-out starts at r ≈ 59.6 so the 57.5
    radius keeps ≥2 mm (asserted at runtime).
  * Upper plate: ROUND Ø115 disc, 2 mm thick, raised so its BOTTOM sits
    ``LEG_H_SCREEN`` mm above the TOP of the lower plate.  Top face is
    planar (print top-down or feet-down — no stubs).
  * 3 legs on vertex azimuths 90/210/330, vertical blades.
  * Feet: 12 mm pads with Φ2.5 blind self-tap pilots (M3x8 from below
    the plate).
  * Screen variant: solid top (no window) + 24×5 mm wire slot under the
    +X short edge of a centered 63×35 screen (GMT020 / ST7789) — outer
    X edge = screen +X edge, narrowed so the +X screw holes clear it —
    plus 4 Ø1.8 M2 self-tap pilot holes at the panel corner holes
    (2.5 mm inset) to hold the screen down.

Outputs under ``extra_stl/`` (printables only -- no cut files):
  * ``hex_raised_platform_110_h28_screen.stl`` -- 28 mm legs, wire slot
  * ``hex_raised_platform_110_h28_screen_preview.png`` -- top + side
  * ``round_mount_plate_115_with_leg_holes.stl`` -- the magnet plate
