"""Standalone, printable FEETECH STS3215 front-face mount + test cradle.

June 2026 redesign foundation
-----------------------------
The prototype is migrating from the DS3225 PWM servo (mounted by its
protruding side TABS onto a printed tab-shelf + heat-set bosses) to the
FEETECH STS3215 serial-bus servo, which has NO tabs.  The STS3215 bolts
via 4x M2.5 THREADED HOLES IN ITS OWN METAL CASE, arranged on a 9.9 mm
square centred on the output shaft, on the front (output) face.

That is a fundamentally different mounting paradigm than the whole
``hexapod_prototype.py`` well/cradle stack is built around, so before
propagating it into all 18 joint cradles (coxa hip / femur knee /
chassis yaw) this module nails down -- and lets you PRINT and validate
against a real servo -- the single reusable mount feature:

    * a front-face PLATE with a small (Phi 10) coupling-clearance bore and
      the 4x case-screw clearance holes on the 9.9 mm square -- the servo
      bolts up through these with M2/M2.5 SELF-TAPPING screws into its own
      (un-tapped, plastic) case; the disc horn mounts on the spline ABOVE
      the plate, plus
    * a body-locating shroud (two side walls) plus a PARTIAL back housing
      that press-fits a BALL BEARING (default 688, 8x16x5) coaxial with the
      output, so the joint is supported on BOTH ends (sandwich), not
      cantilevered.  The back housing covers only the +X (idler-axis) half;
      the -X half stays open for the JST bus connectors, cover and cables.

All STS3215 dimensions below are taken from FEETECH's official STEP
(SO-ARM100 ``STS3215_03a.step``); this file deliberately does NOT import
the (still DS3225-valued) ``SERVO_*`` constants from
``hexapod_prototype`` so it is self-contained and safe to print while the
in-model refit is still in progress.

Frame (matches how the servo is used in a leg):
    +X = body long axis, output shaft offset toward +X
    +Y = body short axis (depth)
    +Z = output-shaft direction (out of the FRONT face)
    origin = centre of the body's BACK (idler) face.
