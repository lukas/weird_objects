"""Run all post-redesign correctness checks on the prototype.

1.  Every part is a clean watertight mesh (manifold, no self-intersections
    that would crash the slicer).
2.  Every servo well has an open insertion path big enough for the body.
3.  Every M3 mounting / chassis-bolt hole drilled by the design code
    actually passes through solid material it's supposed to anchor in.
3b. The L-shaped wire-exit corridor at every cradle's -X bottom-OUTBOARD
    corner lets a WIRE_SLOT_W-wide harness reach free space without
    intersecting solid part material.
4.  In standing pose, no two printed parts overlap in volume by more than
    100 mm^3.
5.  In standing pose, the three servo bodies (yaw / hip-pitch / knee-pitch)
    sit in their cradles without poking into solid printed material.
6.  No printed part has a STRUCTURALLY-SIGNIFICANT region thinner than
    MIN_PRINT_T mm (Hildebrand max-inscribed-ball local thickness on a
    voxelised occupancy field).
6b. None of the structural LEG LINK parts has a thin SHEET / WEB --
    a region of material extended in 2D but thinner than MIN_SHEET_T
    in the third direction.  Catches "thick block - THIN SHEET -
    thick block" topology that 6. misses because an inscribed ball
    fits happily inside a thin slab.

Exit code 0 = all checks pass.  Exit code 1 = at least one failure.

Robust inside-test
------------------

We do NOT use ``trimesh.proximity.signed_distance`` or
``Trimesh.contains`` directly: both give false positives on the
boolean-union'd meshes used by `make_coxa_*`/`make_femur_*` (the
internal cavities created by the body-pocket cuts confuse the
ray-casting heuristic).  Instead we shoot 6 axis-aligned rays from
each test point and call the point INSIDE iff a majority of rays
report an odd number of intersections with the mesh.  This majority
vote is much more robust on borderline / non-manifold input.

Speed: mesh cache + process-pool dispatch
-----------------------------------------

Every printable part is built ONCE via ``_load_mesh(name)`` and
re-used (copied where mutated) across every check that needs it.
The check suite then runs in a ``concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor``
pool: parent process builds the master cache, pickles it via the
pool ``initializer=`` so each worker boots with every mesh
already preloaded, then submits the independent ``check_*`` checks
plus the per-pose chunks of ``check_workspace_self_collision``.
Results stream back as ``(name, ok, captured_stdout)`` tuples and
the parent prints them in DECLARATION ORDER -- the on-screen output
stays byte-for-byte identical to a serial run.

CLI flags
---------

* ``--serial`` -- skip the process pool and run every check in the main
  process in declaration order.  Use this when a worker traceback is
  mangled through pickle and you need a clean stack.
* ``--workers N`` -- override the default worker count (default is
  ``min(8, os.cpu_count())``).
* ``--profile PATH`` -- dump a cProfile snapshot of the PARENT process
  to ``PATH`` so you don't need the ``python -m cProfile`` wrapper.
  Workers are NOT profiled; combine with ``--serial`` if you want a
  full-suite profile.
* ``--only CHECK_NAME`` (repeatable) -- run only the named check(s);
  any check whose declaration-list name matches at least one ``--only``
  value is included.  Useful for iterating on a single check.
* ``--with-arm`` -- also run the OPTIONAL arm verification.

# Why a separate check?  ``check_flimsy_joints`` above uses the
# Hildebrand max-inscribed-ball local thickness, which only catches
# features that are thin in ALL THREE directions (spikes, pillars,
# hair-thin necks).  An inscribed sphere of radius MIN_PRINT_T/2 fits
# happily inside any 3 mm-thick slab, so a thin SHEET / WEB (thin in
# one direction, extended in the other two) sails through Hildebrand
# no matter how unprintably thin its load-bearing slab actually is.
#
# This check (a anisotropic chord variant of Hildebrand) computes the
# per-voxel MIN DIRECTIONAL CHORD LENGTH: for each occupied voxel V we
# measure the length, in mm, of the contiguous run of occupied voxels
# containing V along the +/-X, +/-Y, and +/-Z lines, then take the
# smallest of the three lengths.  Voxels whose min directional chord
# falls inside the STRUCTURAL-NECK BAND (between
# ``MIN_SHEET_T_LOWER`` and ``MIN_SHEET_T_UPPER`` mm) are clustered;
# the part FAILS if the largest cluster exceeds ``MAX_SHEET_BUDGET_VOX``.
#
# Why the LOWER bound (5 mm, not 0)?  Features thinner than this lower
# bound fall into one of two well-understood categories:
#
#   1. Unprintably thin (chord <= MIN_PRINT_T = 3 mm) -- the Hildebrand
#      check above already flags these.
#   2. Intentional thin PERIMETER walls / plates (servo well walls
#      WELL_WALL_Y = 4.5 mm, chassis plate CHASSIS_PLATE_T = 4 mm,
#      the retired servo horn adapter HORN_ADAPTER_T = 4 mm).  The user has
#      explicitly accepted these thicknesses in the design notes --
#      they are NOT structural load-path necks, and flagging them
#      here would just generate noise.
#
# The 5-6 mm "structural neck band" sits above the intentional thin-
# wall floor and at-or-below the user's MIN_SHEET_T = 6 mm.  The user's
# complaint with ``coxa_link`` (the arm slab between the hub and the
# well at 6 mm thick) lands squarely inside this band -- it's a slab
# that's "thick enough to look OK at a glance but thin enough to bend
# under load".

# physical slab thickness, but can be up to one voxel pitch LARGER
# when the slab is sandwiched against another piece of solid

# huge anisotropic "thin sheet" cluster under THIS test.  Flagging
# the femur / tibia spar would just generate noise -- they are not
# the "thick block - thin sheet - thick block" topology the user

# Robust inside-test (majority vote over 6 axis-aligned rays)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``points_inside`` has TWO interchangeable implementations:
#
#   * ``_points_inside_rays``  -- the historical 6-axis ray-vote.  Robust
#     against the boolean-union false positives that broke trimesh's
#     ``mesh.contains`` on early prototype geometry, but slow because
#     each call shoots 6 N-point ray batches and pays the rtree spatial
#     index cost on every batch.  This is what the original
#     ``points_inside`` was.
#
#   * ``_points_inside_contains`` -- a direct ``mesh.contains(pts)``
#     call.  Watertight meshes only -- if the input mesh is not water-
#     tight, trimesh's containment heuristic can disagree with the ray
#     vote on points near holes / non-manifold edges.  All cached
#     meshes are validated by ``check_watertight`` so this should be
#     equivalent to the ray vote in practice.  Much faster than 6
#     ray-cast batches per call (in profile the ray vote is >= 80% of
#     verifier wall time; mesh.contains is on the order of one ray
#     batch instead of six, plus avoids the rtree-per-direction work).
#
# A dispatcher (``points_inside``) picks between them via a module-
# level ``_inside_mode`` set from the CLI ``--inside-mode`` flag.  In
# the special ``both`` mode the dispatcher RUNS BOTH implementations,
# records every disagreement to ``_inside_mismatches``, prints a
# ``[MISMATCH]`` line to stderr, and STILL returns the ray-vote answer
# (so the rest of the check suite behaves byte-identically to a pure
# ``rays`` run while we collect equivalence evidence).  ``main()``
# exits with code 2 when any mismatch is recorded, so CI catches the
# discrepancy.

# 1c.  Single-body connectivity (no floating islands)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every PRINTED part must come off the bed as ONE connected solid.  A
# disconnected island (a ring / boss / lip that lost the material that
# bridged it to the body) is a hard defect: it either drops off in the
# print or, worse, prints as loose debris inside the part.  Such artifacts
# are easy to introduce in parametric boolean CAD -- e.g. enlarging a bore
# or raising a shroud so a feature loses its overlap with the hub.  (June
# 2026: the spaced-6706-bearing-pair coxa rework left the yaw hub's Phi51.6
# dust-lip skirt floating 0.6 mm clear of a Phi44 platform; this guard was
# added to catch exactly that and any future recurrence.)
#
# Implementation note -- why a VOLUME filter, not a raw split count:
# ``mesh.split(only_watertight=False)`` faithfully returns every connected
# face cluster, INCLUDING zero-thickness coplanar patches that boolean ops
# sometimes shed on a flat face (e.g. chassis_bottom_lower's z=-2 underside
# splits into ~14 such 0.000 mm^3 sheets).  Those are mesh artifacts, not
# floating MATERIAL, so we count only components whose |volume| exceeds
# CONNECTIVITY_MIN_BODY_VOL.  A genuine floating island is bulk solid (the
# dust-lip ring was ~1940 mm^3), orders of magnitude above the threshold.
CONNECTIVITY_MIN_BODY_VOL = 1.0   # mm^3 -- below this is a meshing artifact

# Every part that ships as its OWN printed STL (one connected piece).  The
# assembled-link meshes (coxa_link / femur_link / tibia_link) are NOT printed
# as single parts -- each is two printed fittings + a CF tube -- so they are
# intentionally excluded; their constituent printed fittings are listed
# instead.  No part here is legitimately multi-body, so there is no
# whitelist: the required real-body count is exactly 1 for all of them.

# 3b.  Wire-exit L-corridor at the -X bottom-OUTBOARD corner of the well
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Note on the previous version of this test
# -----------------------------------------
# An earlier ``check_wire_slot`` looked at TWO probe points in well-local
# coords -- one expected-VOID at (-25, 0, 0) and one expected-SOLID at
# (-25, 0, 10) -- and asserted the latter must be intact -X wall material.
# That assumption was stale: ``_wire_exit_slot`` was extended in the recent
# redesign to also cut a vertical CHANNEL into the -X wall above the L
# exit (so wires lying against the body's back-case can run down the wall
# face into the L), which legitimately removes material at well-local
# x in [-24.7, -17.5], z in [0, ~30].  The "SOLID" probe at (-25, 0, 10)
# sat 0.3 mm outboard of the channel in X, but the test sampled a 1 mm
# cube around it whose inboard voxels (x = -24.5) fell INSIDE the
# channel cut, so the test always reported the wall as broken even
# though the wall material it cares about (the M3 pilot zone above the
# channel top) was fully intact.  The M3 pilot wall is already
# independently verified by ``check_bolt_holes`` ("M3 pilots in well
# wall"), so the wire-exit check should focus on the wire's path and
# not on incidental wall geometry above it.
#
# What this check now models
# --------------------------
# A hobby servo's 3-wire harness exits the body at the bottom-outboard
# CORNER (well-local -X face of the body, at z=0, around y=0).  The
# wire must be able to reach FREE SPACE outside the cradle via the
# L-shaped slot.  The slot supports two routings out of the corner:
#
#   * LATERAL leg:  bundle travels in -X out through the bottom of the
#                   -X wall, past the part's outer face.
#   * DOWNWARD leg: bundle travels in -Z down through the well floor,
#                   past the part's outer bottom face.
#
# Each leg is a 3D corridor with cross-section ~WIRE_SLOT_W (Y) x ~3 mm
# (orthogonal).  We sample a grid of points inside each corridor in
# well-local coordinates and transform them into the part's frame via
# the same R / translation chain ``make_*`` applies to the well solid.
# A corridor is "clear" if every sampled point is OUTSIDE the part
# mesh.  The check PASSES if AT LEAST ONE corridor is clear -- the
# wire only needs ONE escape route, and a closed top flange (the user's
# recent reinforcement on the coxa bracket) does not interfere with
# either leg of the L.

# Wire bundle Y margin from the slot's Y face -- the slot is sized for
# bundled / jacketed harnesses (WIRE_SLOT_W = 7 mm), the wire itself
# needs much less so we sample inside the slot Y span by this margin.

# 5b.  Horn-stack clearance inside output-side mating cylinders
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why this check exists
# ---------------------
# Every rotary joint (yaw, hip-pitch, knee-pitch) connects the servo's
# spline to the next printed link via this physical stack, laid out
# along the joint axis (+Y in each driven part's local frame):
#
#     servo body  |  output gear  |  disc horn (link bolts here)
#     y < 0       |  y in [-6, 0] |  y in [0, +5]  -> y = HORN_STACK_H
#                                  ^               ^
#                                spline tip       link mating face
#                                = joint axis
#
# Design B (May 2026) + June 2026 disc-horn switch: the printed
# servo_horn_adapter and the plastic X-horn are both retired.
# The link's pad now bolts DIRECTLY onto the disc horn (the 20 mm
# aluminum 25T disc that screws onto the spline), so the horn stack is
# the disc horn alone -- HORN_STACK_H = PLASTIC_HORN_H = 5 mm (was 9 mm
# when the printed adapter sat on top of the plastic horn).
#
# The driven printed part (coxa_link for yaw, femur_link for hip-pitch,
# tibia_link for knee-pitch) sits ABOVE the disc horn at femur/tibia
# y >= HORN_STACK_H = +5, with a 4-bolt clamp pad on DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD =
# 14 mm.  The part's "neck" / flange ring -- the material between the
# pad's mating face (y = HORN_STACK_H) and the spar's +Y face
# (y = LINK_THICKNESS/2 = +3) -- MUST be free of plastic anywhere
# inside the conservative horn-sweep envelope (still sized to the
# now-retired plastic X-horn) plus a small clearance margin.
#
# May 2026 "shorten-neck" refactor: the link's flange-ring inner
# radius switched from ``HORN_ADAPTER_OD/2 + 0.5`` = 16.5 mm (sized
# for the now-retired printed servo_horn_adapter) to
# ``HORN_STACK_VOID_R`` = ``PLASTIC_HORN_X_TIP_R + 0.5`` = 18.5 mm
# (sized for the now-retired plastic X-horn's Phi 36 mm sweep -- the user
# found that the previous Phi 33 mm cup physically blocked the
# Phi 36 mm horn from fitting; the smaller disc horn keeps that envelope
# as headroom).  This probe radius tracks the same constant so the
# verifier follows the link geometry automatically.
#
# This is exactly the failure mode the user reported as "the femur link
# doesn't let the end of the servo stick out high enough to connect to
# the tibia link" -- the tibia knee-pad's neck cylinder was a solid
# Phi HIP_PAD_R*2 = 34 mm column that punched straight through the
# Phi 32 mm horn-adapter footprint (the retired printed adapter).
#
# Test geometry
# -------------
# We build a single horn-stack cylinder of radius
# HORN_STACK_VOID_R (= PLASTIC_HORN_X_TIP_R + HORN_STACK_CLEARANCE =
# 18.5 mm) and height HORN_STACK_H, centred on the joint axis at
# y in [0, HORN_STACK_H], and probe each driven printed part for
# material inside that volume.  The check is done in each part's
# LOCAL frame -- both the femur and tibia have their joint axis at
# the origin with +Y along the horn-stack direction, so a single
# cylinder template works for both.
#
# Tolerance: the budget catches the well-defined "solid column"
# failure (~ 500-2000 mm^3 of interpenetration) without flaring on
# the < 50 mm^3 of voxel-stair-step artefact along the pad's bottom
# rim where the neck-clearance void's CYLINDRICAL boundary meets the
# pad's CIRCULAR-DISC boundary on slightly mismatched voxel grids.

# 5c.  Horn-SWEEP clearance in the YAW joint (coxa_bracket side)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES that 5b above does NOT
# ----------------------------------------
# check_horn_stack_clearance (5b) probes the DRIVEN side of each joint:
# the femur_link's hub at the hip-pitch joint, and the tibia_link's hub
# at the knee-pitch joint.  At the YAW joint the driven part is the
# coxa_link, whose printed volume sits ABOVE the horn-stack -- not in
# its way -- so 5b correctly skips the yaw joint.
#
# But the YAW joint also has a NON-DRIVEN side -- the coxa_bracket --
# which holds the servo body and whose flange / walls / gussets sit
# RIGHT NEXT TO the rotating gear stack + disc horn (the printed
# adapter is retired).  Nothing in the existing checks ever probed the
# cylindrical sweep volume above the seated yaw servo.  The recurring
# "the servo motor doesn't stick out high enough in the coxa bracket"
# failure lives here: a flange / gusset / boss that intrudes into the
# horn-sweep cylinder physically prevents the disc horn from rotating
# (or worse, prevents the horn stack from seating above the bracket in
# the first place).
#
# WHY 5b's CYLINDER WAS THE WRONG SIZE (for the YAW joint)
# --------------------------------------------------------
# 5b uses radius HORN_STACK_VOID_R = PLASTIC_HORN_X_TIP_R + 0.5 =
# 18.5 mm, sized for the now-retired plastic X-horn's sweep.  But 5b's
# height is HORN_STACK_H = 5 mm, which covers only the disc-horn
# stack, NOT the SERVO_OUTPUT_H = 6 mm gear-stack region between the
# body's top face and the disc horn's bottom face.  A bracket wall
# that wraps over the top of the well to z = +13 mm in bracket-local
# clears the retired printed adapter (which lived above z = +18 in
# legacy coords) but clobbers the gear stack and the disc horn
# underneath.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECK DOES
# --------------------
# Build a vertical cylinder centred on the BRACKET-LOCAL YAW AXIS at
# (x = -SERVO_OUTPUT_X = 0 in bracket coords after the servo offset
# is applied, y = 0).  Its radius is the larger of the retired printed
# adapter's half-OD and the disc horn's tip radius (read from the
# bounding cylinder of the "servo_horn" registry mesh, which now maps
# to ``make_disc_horn``, so the test stays in sync with the modelled
# hardware geometry), plus a small clearance.  Its Z range covers the
# ENTIRE rotating stack:
#
#     z_lo = bracket-local Z of the seated body's TOP face
#            (= SERVO_BODY_H - WELL_RIM_Z, taking WELL_TAB_FLOAT=0 as
#            the worst-case body-seats-lower scenario so the cylinder
#            covers the full gear-stack region even if the tabs sit
#            slightly below their nominal float height)
#     z_hi = z of the horn-stack TOP face + 1 mm extra margin
#
# Any sample voxel inside both the bracket mesh AND this cylinder is
# a FAIL.  The cylinder MUST be entirely VOID inside the printed
# coxa_bracket -- this is not a "soft budget", it's a hard pass /
# fail.

# 5d.  Disc-horn FIT / clearance (the disc actually fits where it seats)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES that 5b / 5c do NOT
# -------------------------------------
# 5b probes the DRIVEN link hub against the (retired-X-horn) envelope;
# 5c probes the AIRSPACE *above* the seat plane that the disc rotates
# through.  NEITHER probes the band the disc-horn BODY physically
# occupies.  The Phi DISC_HORN_OD = 20 mm aluminium disc screws onto the
# 25T output spline and rides on the servo's output boss -- so its
# underside sits at body-front + SERVO_OUTPUT_H and its body spans the
# DISC_HORN_H-tall band ABOVE that.  Every printed feature the disc
# passes through / seats in MUST clear at least Phi DISC_HORN_OD there.
#
# WHY 5c PASSED A BROKEN LAYOUT
# -----------------------------
# 5c starts its sweep cylinder at horn_base_z = body_top + WELL_PLATE_T
# (the mount-PLATE top) on the assumption the disc floats above the
# plate.  But the servo's output boss only lifts the disc SERVO_OUTPUT_H
# (2 mm) above the body face -- NOT WELL_PLATE_T (4 mm) -- so the disc's
# lower ~2 mm actually sits INSIDE the plate band.  The chassis_bottom
# yaw cradle bored that band to only Phi SERVO_OUTPUT_BORE_OD (10 mm)
# "for the coupling/spline", so a Phi 20 disc rammed the plate and could
# not seat -- yet 5c, probing only ABOVE plate-top, reported the cradle
# clear.  This check probes the REAL disc-body band (from the boss seat
# up), at Phi DISC_HORN_OD, so a 10 mm-hole-for-a-20 mm-disc regression
# in ANY fixed cradle is caught.
#
# The disc is a circle -> rotationally invariant -> the swept envelope of
# the spinning disc is itself Phi DISC_HORN_OD, so a static Phi
# DISC_HORN_OD cylinder IS the swept envelope here (the larger hub +
# coxa-link that spin above the disc are covered by 5c's airspace probe).
DISC_HORN_FIT_TOL = 40.0   # mm^3 -- voxel-grid artefact budget (a real

# 6.  Flimsy joints (local thickness from a 3D distance transform)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# What the check computes
# -----------------------
# For each printed part:
#
#   1. Voxelise the (watertight) mesh on a uniform grid at
#      ``FLIMSY_VOXEL_PITCH``.  Trimesh's ``mesh.voxelized().fill()``
#      gives a 3D boolean occupancy array.
#
#   2. Compute the 3D Euclidean distance transform of the occupancy
#      (``scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt``).  At each interior
#      voxel this returns ``dt(V)`` = distance, in voxels, to the
#      nearest empty voxel.
#
#   3. A voxel V is **thick** iff some inscribed ball of radius
#      ``MIN_PRINT_T / 2`` (entirely inside the solid) contains V --
#      i.e. there exists a "core" voxel P (one whose ``dt(P)`` >=
#      ``MIN_PRINT_T / 2 / pitch``) with ``|V - P| <= MIN_PRINT_T/2``.
#      Equivalently: V is thick iff its distance to the nearest core
#      voxel is at most ``MIN_PRINT_T / 2 / pitch``, which is another
#      EDT pass.  The Hildebrand 1997 max-inscribed-ball formulation
#      avoids the well-known surface-fuzz pitfall of the naive
#      "2 * dt" definition: every surface voxel of a healthy 4 mm
#      wall sits at dt = 1.0 voxel, so the naive definition would
#      flag the WHOLE outer shell of every thick part as flimsy.
#
#   4. Flimsy voxels are the occupied ones NOT covered by a thick
#      ball.  Cluster them with ``scipy.ndimage.label``; tiny clusters
#      (< ``MIN_CLUSTER_VOX``) are dismissed as voxel-grid noise.
#
#   5. Report each cluster's centroid (part-local mm), bounding box
#      extent, minimum thickness, and voxel count.  The check PASSES
#      if the largest cluster in any single part stays at or below
#      ``MAX_FLIMSY_BUDGET_VOX``.

# Targeted bridge-joint check: coxa_link's top-piece <-> servo-well joint
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why this exists -- and why ``check_flimsy_joints`` alone cannot see this
# failure mode:
#
# In ``make_coxa_link`` the HORN YOKE (the top hub bolted to the yaw
# servo's disc horn) is tied to the SERVO WELL BOX (the cradle that
# holds the hip-pitch servo) by an X-long, Y-thin BRIDGE slab that lives
# in the Z-gap between the well's outer top face and the hub/arm bottom
# face.  The bridge's cross-section (with the baseline geometry) is
# 53 mm long in X, 6.75 mm thick in Y, ~14.5 mm tall in Z; the bridge
# overlaps the well's outer body by just 0.5 mm in Y and 1.5 mm in Z,
# giving a 53 x 0.5 x 1.5 = ~40 mm^3 bonded interface holding the entire
# leg load.  ``pad_sweep_clear`` -- the cylindrical void that lets the
# femur hip pad swing through the link's interior -- then EATS a circular
# hole through this already-thin bridge across most of its X span,
# leaving only thin slivers at the inboard / outboard X extremes.
#
# Why ``check_flimsy_joints`` doesn't catch it: the Hildebrand
# max-inscribed-ball check (``_flimsy_clusters_for_part`` above) measures
# isotropic LOCAL thickness via a distance transform; an inscribed sphere
# of radius MIN_PRINT_T/2 = 1.5 mm fits inside the bridge slab (6.75 mm
# Y) without a problem, so the test happily reports the bridge as healthy.
# ``check_thin_sheets`` (the anisotropic chord variant) ALSO misses this
# because the pedestal sits directly above the inboard half of the bridge
# (link y in [-17, +17] for the pedestal vs. y in [-17.25, -10.5] for the
# bridge), and its Y-chord through the bridge merges with the pedestal's
# Y-chord into a ~34 mm-long combined chord that's outside the
# 5-7.2 mm "structural-neck" band.  The bridge's Y-thinness is only
# visible at link x > +17 (outboard of the pedestal), where ``gusset``
# and ``gusset_under`` add a few extra mm of Y material -- pushing the
# combined chord out of the band again.
#
# So we need an explicit slice-based check whose window EXCLUDES the
# pedestal and targets the bridge alone.  The check below slices the
# coxa_link mesh horizontally at multiple Z heights in the gap between
# the well's outer top and the hub bottom, intersects each slice with an
# outboard-of-pedestal X-Y window, and computes (a) the area of the
# resulting cross-section and (b) the bending section modulus Sx about
# the slice's local X axis (the bridge's weakest bending direction --
# flexure in YZ caused by the well's leg-load Y reaction torque).
#
# Thresholds are tuned to FAIL on the baseline ``make_coxa_link()`` (so
# the recurring "top of coxa_link is not attached strongly to the part
# housing the servo" complaint is caught the first time it appears) and
# PASS comfortably on a wall-widening / pad fix that adds the user's
# requested "rectangular block at the top of the well":
#
#   * Area >= 80 mm^2 minimum slice  -- matches the user's "~ 8 x 10 mm
#     of plastic" intuition (parent agent's spec).
#   * Sx_bend >= 100 mm^3            -- bending modulus of the OUTBOARD
#     bridge slice about its local X axis.  Baseline geometry has
#     Sx_bend ~ 6 mm^3 at the worst slice (essentially zero); a 5 mm
#     well-top wall extension lifts it well past 100 mm^3 because the
#     extra plastic is offset from the centroid in Y and shows up
#     quadratically in Ixx.

# Second bridge sub-check: per-X YZ cross-section probe.
#
# The XY-slice check above averages cross-section over the full bridge X
# range (-12 .. +41) -- so a 53 mm-long bridge with FAT plastic at the X
# extremes (where pad_sweep_clear does not reach) and THIN plastic in
# the middle (at x ~ COXA_LENGTH = +25, where pad_sweep_clear eats most
# of the bridge + pad) reports a healthy 157 mm^2 slice area even when
# the middle is a 4 mm-thin vertical strip.  That's exactly the failure
# mode the user pointed at in the May 18 screenshot ("you made the wrong
# wall thicker -- the joint in the middle left is whats thin").
#
# This second sub-check takes a YZ cross-section at EVERY 1 mm in X
# across the bridge X range, intersects with a bridge-only YZ window,
# and reports the minimum cross-section area + minimum Y-thickness at
# each x. The "Y-thickness" is the maximum y-extent of any horizontal
# slab inside the slice (i.e. the widest section the bridge maintains
# at some z): the bridge ties the well in Y direction, so Y-thickness
# is the structural metric in bending and shear.

# ANY x in the bridge x range catches the cylinder-cut middle.

# ----------
# ``check_self_collision`` above tests ONE static standing pose
# (yaw = 0, femur_pitch = STANCE_FEMUR_DEG = -25 deg, knee_pitch =
# STANCE_TIBIA_DEG = +60 deg) with the CHASSIS removed from the scene.
# Pose-dependent tibia-vs-coxa-link / tibia-vs-chassis collisions are
# therefore invisible to that check.  This sweep builds the leg
# parametrically over (yaw, femur_pitch, knee_pitch), places the
# chassis (top + bottom plates, battery holder, electronics tray) in
# the same world frame, and checks pairwise mesh overlap volume across
# the full RUNTIME joint workspace.
#

#               the workspace audit; the +ve side was tightened to keep
#               the femur hip pad clear of the chassis_top (which was

# June 2026 disc-horn switch: direct-to-disc-horn pad pattern
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The link's pad now bolts DIRECTLY onto the 20 mm aluminum 25T disc
# horn (no printed servo_horn_adapter disc in the stack; the earlier
# plastic 4-arm X-horn scheme is also retired).  Each driven link MUST
# therefore carry:
#
#   1. A 4 x M3-clearance hole pattern on a DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD = 14 mm
#      bolt circle, drilled through the pad's mating face along the
#      joint axis (link +Z for coxa_link; link +Y for femur_link /
#      tibia_link).  Phi DISC_HORN_BOLT_OD = 3.4 mm (M3 clearance with
#      0.2 mm FDM print tolerance) -- the M3 SHCS threads into the
#      aluminium disc's M3 TAPPED holes (the disc is the thread-
#      engagement medium).  The retired plastic X-horn scheme used
#      4 x M2 self-tap holes on a 20.8 mm PCD instead.  See
#      hexapod_prototype.py DISC_HORN_BOLT_* docstring.
#   2. (coxa_link ONLY) A central Phi DISC_HORN_COLLAR_OD = 9 mm
#      cylindrical bore DISC_HORN_COLLAR_DEPTH = 2 mm deep cut into the
#      pad's mating face, so the disc horn's raised central spline
#      collar + M3 centre-screw head is cleared and the disc seats
#      flat below the pad.  (The retired plastic horn used a wider
#      Phi 16 mm x 1.2 mm hub recess.)
#      May 2026 solid-pad simplification: the femur_link and
#      tibia_link historically dropped the wide recess -- their
#      hip/knee pads mate to the disc horn with a flat face.  They now
#      carry the same small spline-collar bore as the coxa cap; the
#      bolt-pattern check only probes the coxa_link's bore here.
#
# This check confirms the 4 bolt holes on every driven part and the
# central recess on the coxa_link by sampling small voxel patches at
# each expected position and requiring the link mesh to be VOID
# there.  A short pillar of pad material at the bolt-PCD ring or at
# the central hub indicates the pad was not drilled / recessed
# correctly.

# Tolerance: small voxel-grid step-noise budget per probe.  Each probe
# samples a Phi (hole_OD/2 - small) x depth column of voxels and
# expects ZERO of them to be inside the link mesh.  A real failure
# (= bolt pattern missing entirely, or recess depth set to 0) leaves
# 100+ voxel samples inside the part.

#
# Each cradle shelf must satisfy THREE structural conditions per bolt

#
#   (1) The pocket is VOID along the Phi 4 mm x 6 mm cylinder so the
#       bolt + insert fit.  This is the renamed legacy "pilot-cyl"
#       probe with the new diameter / depth.
#   (2) The annular ring of plastic at radius
#       INSERT_M3_PILOT_OD/2 + CRADLE_BOSS_MIN_WALL_MM = 3.5 mm
#       around the pocket axis is SOLID at every azimuth.  This is

#       Phi 2.5 mm self-tap pilots ship with 0.00-1.50 mm of plastic
#       on one side of the bolt -- the verifier's vertical pilot
#       probe (commit b447f88) only confirmed the pilot cylinder

#       (pocket_bottom + 1 mm and pocket_top - 1 mm) and require

#   (3) The annular ring between the pocket OD and the heat-set

def check_cradle_insert_pockets():
    """Verify each cradle has 2 heat-set insert sites on the -X column
    (Design E mixed-mode, May 2026).

    For each of the 6 (cradle, x = -X, y = +/- Y) HEAT-SET sites we
    probe THREE conditions:

      (1) the Phi INSERT_M3_PILOT_OD x INSERT_M3_PILOT_DEPTH POCKET
          is VOID along the bolt axis (the renamed legacy pilot-cyl
          probe);
      (2) the annular ring at radius
          INSERT_M3_PILOT_OD/2 + CRADLE_BOSS_MIN_WALL_MM around the
          pocket axis is SOLID at 8 azimuths x 2 z-planes -- the
          radial-material check that the original Phi 2.5 mm self-
          tap verifier was missing;
      (3) the annular ring between the pocket OD and the heat-set
          insert OD is SOLID at 8 azimuths so the knurl has plastic
          to displace at install time.

    The 2 +X sites per cradle are NOT probed by this check.  Under
    Design E they no longer have heat-set inserts -- they have bare
    Phi 2.5 mm self-tap pilots in the existing well-wall material
    (the Phi 8 mm heat-set boss could not coexist with the restored
    +X wire channel).  Those +X sites are documented as
    "known-thin" on the channel-facing side (~ 0.25 mm of plastic
    between the pilot and the channel), which is acceptable for an
    M3 self-tap into PLA / PETG and is enforced by
    ``check_servo_insertion_path`` rather than by a radial-material
    check.  See the INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_* block in
    ``hexapod_prototype.py`` for the full rationale.

    The cradles are tested in their UNROTATED, UNTRANSLATED local
    (well-local) frames so we don't have to undo each cradle's
    R / delta math.

    Per-case radial-wall tolerance (May 2026, commit 5.5/9)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Each case carries a ``radial_air_frac`` value that controls how
    many of its radial / knurl-ring azimuth probes are allowed to
    fall in AIR before the case fails:

      * Legacy cradles (coxa_bracket / coxa_link / femur_link)
        carry the strict tolerance ``radial_air_frac = 0.0`` -- ALL
        azimuths around the 2 -X heat-set sites must be inside
        printed plastic.  The wire-exit L-corridor on these
        cradles stays on +X (no mirror) so the -X column has no
        channel intrusion and the bosses keep their full 360-deg
        radial wall.

      * The chassis_bottom integrated yaw cradle (added by commit
        7/9, the verifier reroute commit; not present in the
        current cases list) carries the relaxed tolerance
        ``radial_air_frac = 0.25``.  That cradle mirrors the
        wire-exit L-corridor to the -X face (so harnesses route
        radially inward toward the per-leg drop slot at chassis-
        frame +46.8, +27, +2) which puts the corridor's lateral
        leg through the -X bosses' inner azimuth band.  The
        corridor cut carves away the inboard ~25 percent of each
        -X boss circumference -- specifically the 8/32 azimuths
        in [3 pi/4, 5 pi/4] facing the cradle interior.

    Engineering rationale for the chassis_bottom relaxation
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Heat-set retention in printed plastic is dominated by the
    knurl-ring's AXIAL bite into the plastic surrounding the
    insert (the knurl teeth dig into the boss wall as the insert
    is pressed in hot, then anneal in place).  With 75 percent
    (24/32) of the boss circumference RETAINED at full
    1.5 mm-min radial wall thickness AND the chassis_bottom
    plate bonded to the boss BOTTOM via the cradle union (the
    boss grows out of the plate top face so the plate provides
    full axial retention on the boss bottom plane), losing 25
    percent of the radial knurl coverage costs approximately 25
    percent of the pull-out force -- a McMaster 94459A130 brass
    insert is rated for ~250 N pull-out at full coverage in
    PA-CF, so the channel-side reduction degrades that to
    ~190 N.  Each servo-tab clamp bolt sees < 30 N tensile load
    under the worst-case yaw-actuator stall torque (DS3225 stall
    ~25 kg-cm = 2.45 N-m, divided over 4 bolts at
    SERVO_TAB_HOLE_PCD/2 = 24.75 mm lever arm gives 24.7 N per
    bolt; doubled to 50 N for shock loading), so 190 N retention
    leaves 3.8 x safety factor on the worst-loaded insert (a 5 x
    margin is the conventional target -- close enough for a
    prototype with bolted redundancy on both -X sites).

    The relaxation is kept LOCALISED to the chassis_bottom case
    via the ``radial_air_frac`` per-case field rather than by
    lowering the global ``CRADLE_BOSS_MIN_WALL_MM`` -- the
    legacy cradles have no channel intrusion and so should
    continue to enforce the strict 0-air-flagged tolerance.

    Mirror rationale + the function-split (``_wire_exit_l_corridor``
    + ``_boot_clearance_channel``) that enables this per-cradle
    exit-face policy live in those helper functions' docstrings
    in ``hexapod_prototype.py`` and in the ``CRADLE_BOSS_*``
    constants block at the top of the same file.

        not be seated in their printed cradles; the user reported
        the regression on receipt of physical hardware.
      * Design E (May 2026) restored the channel cap to

# an insertion PATH, so the captured pocket shipped silently.

# a real Phi 34 constriction forces the full Phi 37 disc through ~80 mm^3 of

# OUTER races can reach their seats in the chassis tower / yaw_bearing_cap.
# This probe verifies the ROTATING INNER races can slide onto the coxa yaw
# HUB BOSS.
#
# Forensic regression probe for the user's "it's not possible to push the
# bearing over the lip on the coxa yaw hub" report.  make_coxa_yaw_hub rides
# both 6706 inner races on a Phi (YAW_HUB_BOSS_OD) boss whose TOP is capped by
# the Phi 44+ turntable platform, so an inner race can only slide on from the
# boss BOTTOM open end.  The old hub carried TWO Phi (YAW_BEARING_INNER_OD)
# retain flanges -- one ABOVE each race -- so the UPPER inner race was trapped
# between the lower flange (below) and the upper flange/platform (above): a
# Phi (YAW_BEARING_ID) bore cannot pass either Phi (YAW_BEARING_INNER_OD)
# flange, so it could not reach its seat from either end.  The static-assembly
# CAD validated the seated state but never an insertion PATH.
#
# This check slides a rigid annulus the size of an inner race's bore..OD band
# (r in [YAW_BEARING_ID/2, YAW_BEARING_INNER_OD/2]) up the boss axis from the
# open (bottom) end to one step below the race's seat-retain shoulder, and
# asserts the swept volume stays collision-free against the printed hub: i.e.
# NO feature of OD > the bore (Phi YAW_BEARING_ID) sits between the seat and
# the open end the race loads from.  The seat-retain shoulder itself (the
# uflange the upper race seats UP against) lives one step ABOVE the swept band
# and is intentionally excluded -- exactly as _sweep_bearing_disc stops a step
# short of the outer-race seat.
#
# Fail-on-old / pass-on-new is proven INLINE by the embedded self-test

# ONE-PIECE-BEARING assembly-sequence probe (Jun 2026)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The forensic gap that shipped two un-assemblable yaw 6706s: every prior
# insertion probe validates ONE race interface IN ISOLATION.
# ``check_bearing_insertion_path`` sweeps only the STATIONARY OUTER race into
# the chassis tower / cap (the cap pocket is "open-top" with the hub absent);
# ``check_hub_inner_race_insertion_path`` sweeps only the ROTATING INNER race
# onto the hub boss (the cap absent).  Each passes independently, but a 6706 is
# ONE RIGID UNIT (inner ring + balls + outer ring, inseparable, ID/OD/W fixed):
# the SAME single annulus must satisfy BOTH its inner (hub boss) AND its outer
# (chassis tower / yaw_bearing_cap) interface along ONE monotone axial
# insertion, with BOTH mating parts PRESENT.  Nothing enforced that.
#
# Forensic finding the cheap isolated probes missed (upper 6706, ID 30 / OD 37
# / W 4):
#   * the hub carries a Phi (YAW_BEARING_INNER_OD)=32 uflange + the Phi 51.6
#     turntable platform CAPPING the boss top, so a rigid annulus cannot come
#     DOWN (-Z) onto the boss from above (the platform is a solid disc the
#     annulus would have to pass through);
#   * the cap bored Phi 34 NECK (z[-1,+2]) BELOW its Phi 37 upper-race pocket,
#     so the same annulus cannot come UP (+Z) from below either (its Phi 37 OD
#     hits the Phi 34 neck).
# Inner interface only clears one direction, outer only the OTHER -> opposite
# directions -> NO single axial insertion exists for the one rigid bearing.
#
# This probe models each REAL bearing as ONE rigid annulus (true ID/OD/W) at
# its seated pose and, for the declared assembly order, sweeps it along BOTH
# axial directions against the union of the joint-stack parts PRESENT when that
# bearing is inserted (hub boss + chassis tower + yaw_bearing_cap), EXCLUDING
# only features that ship as SEPARATE post-install retainer parts (a retainer
# installed AFTER the bearing is legitimately absent during its insertion).
# A bearing is ASSEMBLABLE iff at least one axial direction has a clear,
# monotone, collision-free path to one step short of its seat -- i.e. NO
# feature on the inner approach with OD > the bearing bore AND NO feature on
# the outer approach with bore < the bearing OD, SIMULTANEOUSLY, along that one
# direction.  The probe FAILS the build if any bearing has NO clear direction.
#
# Embedded FAIL-ON-OLD self-test: a reconstructed platform-capped + uflanged
# boss UNION a Phi-34-necked cap traps the rigid upper annulus in BOTH
# directions; the probe MUST report it un-assemblable, proving it is sensitive
# enough to catch the captured-bearing regression the live split design fixes.

# along the driver-approach direction (= -axis_world).  Fail if any
# printed part intrudes into that cylinder by more than
# DRIVER_INTRUSION_TOLERANCE_MM3 mm^3.
#
# The probe cylinder size is picked per-fastener based on the kind of
# tool the assembler actually needs to drive that fastener.  Probing
# every SHCS with the worst-case Phillips envelope (12 mm dia x 80 mm
# long) overstates the required clearance by a large margin and
# produces FAILs at fasteners that a real assembler can drive with
# their fingers and a 25 mm-long L-shaped hex key with no trouble.
#
# The three envelopes:
#
# * HEX_KEY  --  L-shaped hex key short-arm (M2.5 / M3 wrench).  The
#                short arm is ~25 mm long and ~3 mm AF; the assembler
#                needs maybe 8 mm of clearance around it for fingers
#                and the long-arm sticking out to the side.  Anything
#                tagged SHCS (or the M2.5 spline center screw, which
#                IS a tiny Phillips on hobby servos but is always
#                SKIPped because it sits captive under the disc horn
#                after assembly -- mapping it here is documentation
#                only, the cone never lands on actual geometry).
#
# * PHILLIPS  -- Full-length Phillips / slotted screwdriver: 12 mm
#                shaft + handle, 80 mm reach.  Used for the foot
#                hinge M3x16 pan-head and any other pan-head or
#                slotted-head fastener.
#
# * SOCKET    -- Small M3-nut driver / 5.5 mm socket on a stub
#                handle.  12 mm OD at the head, ~50 mm of reach
#                (shorter than Phillips because nut drivers don't
#                need to land on a recessed cross-shape).  Used for
#                the M3 nyloc nuts that aren't captive in a hex
#                pocket (e.g. the chassis bolt nuts under the
#                chassis_bottom, the foot hinge nut).
#
# DRIVER_INTRUSION_TOLERANCE_MM3 mirrors the OTHER_TOLERANCE = 30 mm^3
# used by check_servo_clearance: at the verifier's 1.5 mm voxel pitch
# a single voxel = 3.4 mm^3, so 30 mm^3 ~= 9 voxels = the noise floor
# for the axis-aligned-ray parity vote on a curved mesh boundary.

# the printed cap / pad above the bolt; the hex key short arm enters
# the counter-bore
# from above so the envelope diameter is bounded by the counter-bore
# clearance (Phi 4 mm) not the larger 8 mm "finger room" diameter
# used for M2.5 / M3 hex keys (those keys are driven with two fingers
# pinched around the long arm, whereas the M2 key is small enough to
# turn with a single finger inside the counter-bore + trough void).
# The short-arm reach is shorter too (typical M2 hex key short arm =

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The 14-check verifier above silently allowed the May 2026 ``coxa_link``
# pedestal regression: the body-insertion trough in ``make_coxa_link``
# slices the entire BOTTOM 25.5 mm out of the 34x34x36 pedestal, leaving
# only a ~10.5 mm cap on top.  The 4 M2 X-horn bolts in
# ``fastener_registry._emit_horn_fasteners_yaw`` were also pinned at
# link-local z = COXA_LIFT + hub_t = 44 mm (TOP of the hub, NOT at the
# link's bottom face) -- so the bolts float entirely inside the hub and
# DO NOT clamp the link to the X-horn at all.  Both bugs survived because
# every existing check probed parts in isolation; nothing tested the
# integrity of the FULL assembly (bolt joins parts, parts mate at faces).
#
# We add two structural checks that together close the gap:
#
# * ``check_fastener_engagement`` -- for every bolt with a length, the
#   head must bear on solid material, the shaft must traverse a single
#   contiguous run of material/closely-mated-parts (no long air spans),
#   and the bolt must JOIN at least 2 distinct printed/horn parts.  The
#   "joins >= 2 parts" rule is the one that catches the yaw mis-placement
#   above (bolt at z = [36, 44] is fully inside the coxa_link hub and
#   doesn't reach the X-horn at z = [-5, 0]).
#
# * ``check_mating_face_contact`` -- a small explicit list of mating
#   faces (coxa_link bottom <-> yaw disc-horn top, femur_link hip pad
#   <-> hip disc horn, tibia_link knee pad <-> knee disc horn,
#   coxa_bracket flange <-> chassis_bottom, foot_pad tongue <-> tibia
#   clevis).  For each
#   face we scan along the joint axis and confirm the two parts mate
#   within ``tolerance_mm``.  The hollowed-out coxa_link pedestal shows
#   up here as a ~25 mm gap at the yaw mating face.
#
# Both checks live in the SAME ``_verify_prototype.py`` module so they
# pick up the existing ``_load_mesh`` cache + ``points_inside``
# dispatcher + worker process pool -- no separate machinery.

# Per-fastener engagement geometry.  ``head_od`` drives the head-bearing
# radial probes, ``shaft_od`` drives the shaft / engagement radial
# probes (we offset by 0.4 mm so the probe sits just OUTSIDE the
# drilled bolt clearance hole -- otherwise every probe sits inside the
# Phi 3.4 mm / Phi 3.2 mm clearance cylinder and reports "AIR"),
# ``engagement_mm`` is the expected thread-engagement length at the
# tip.  Default values are used for any spec missing from the table.

    tibia_link) so it rotates RIGIDLY with that link.  At the neutral
    stance pose the relevant rotations are:

      * yaw    -- 0 deg (coxa_link is in the same Rz(a) frame as the

                    rotation; the un-rotated well transform already
                    matches the link frame).
      * hip    -- horn rotates with the FEMUR (driven link) about
                    the hip joint Y axis.  The hip well lives in the
                    coxa_link (parent), so the horn's rotation
                    RELATIVE to the well is ``STANCE_FEMUR_DEG``.
      * knee   -- horn rotates with the TIBIA (driven link) about
                    the knee joint Y axis.  The knee well lives in
                    the FEMUR (parent of the knee joint), so the

    Pre-fix the horn was placed via ``_well_cradle_T @ horn_offset``
    for ALL three joints, which corresponds to "horn in the SERVO's
    well frame".  For yaw that is also the link frame (no link
    rotation), but for hip / knee the femur / tibia rotates about the
    joint axis at the neutral stance angle and the horn rotates with
    it.  Without this rotation the femur / tibia horn bolts (which
    are placed in femur- / tibia-local frame and therefore inherit
    the link's stance rotation) MISS the un-rotated horn arms in the
    world frame and report ``joins only 1 part [femur_link]`` /

# Each entry in CHECKS is ``(display_name, callable_name)``: the parent
# process pre-builds the mesh cache, the worker initializer ships it to
# every spawn-mode worker, and each worker runs the named check with
# ``redirect_stdout`` capturing every print.  The parent emits captured
# output in DECLARATION ORDER (the index in CHECKS) so the on-screen
# output is byte-identical to the serial run.
#
# What's missing from CHECKS: ``check_workspace_self_collision``.  It is
# itself a fan-out of per-pose tasks, so the orchestrator passes the
# (already-warm) pool to it and the workspace sweep submits its own
# per-pose jobs into the same pool.  Running it INSIDE the pool as a
# single job would serialise the 176 poses inside one worker, which is
# precisely what we don't want.

# --fast mode: the 5 ESSENTIAL checks
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Profiled wall-time analysis (May 2026, see _verify_profile.txt) showed
# the full suite spent ~80 % of its time in the 6-axis ray-vote
# point-in-mesh helper, which is itself dominated by the workspace
# self-collision sweep (175 poses) and screwdriver-access / horn-sweep
# / cradle-insertion / flimsy-joint voxelisation work.  Most edits to
# the parametric CAD don't change anything that those slow checks
# probe; they break one of FIVE invariants that are cheap to test:
#
#   1.  ``check_watertight``      -- every printed STL is manifold.
#                                    Caught by trimesh's rtree boundary
#                                    pass; sub-second.
#   5.  ``check_self_collision`` -- standing-pose pairwise overlap.
#                                    One pose, voxel pitch 1.5 mm; the
#                                    175-pose sweep ("Workspace self-
#                                    collision") is the SLOW workspace
#                                    sweep, not this one.
#  15.  ``check_fastener_engagement`` -- every bolt's head bears, tip
#                                    engages, shaft span clears, and
#                                    the bolt joins >= 2 distinct
#                                    parts.  Probes are 8-azimuth
#                                    rings; ~ 1-3 s.
#  16.  ``check_mating_face_contact`` -- the 3 horn / link mating
#                                    interfaces close within tolerance.
#                                    Pure ray-cast; sub-second.
#  17.  ``check_cable_clearance``  -- every cable / connector keepout
#                                    is free of solid material.
#                                    Voxel-grid probes through 10
#                                    keepouts; ~ 1-2 s.
#
# Together these 5 catch ~ 80 % of the historical regressions
# (off-by-one bracket geometry, wrong bolt length, missing hole, mating
# face moved, cable channel obliterated) in ~ 15 % of the wall time
# of the full suite (~ 5-15 s vs ~ 95-270 s on this machine, depending
# on whether the cache is warm).  They are the "tight inner loop" set;
# anything else either has its own faster up-stream check (e.g. the
# spec-bounds validator catches gross dimension drift before the
# verifier even runs) or is the slow 175-pose / voxel-union work that
# only needs to re-run when joint kinematics or printed walls change.
#
# Run them with ``--fast``; ``--all`` (the default when no flag is
# passed) runs every entry in ``CHECKS`` plus the workspace sweep.

# ``_build_standing_leg`` / ``_build_world_leg0_printed_parts`` /

# Schema: (check_name, input_hash) -> (result_pass, runtime_s,
# message, timestamp_unix).  On every invocation we prune entries
# older than CACHE_MAX_AGE_S (= 30 days) so the file stays small
# across long-lived branches.
#
# Workflow:
#   * Cache HIT -> print "  [CACHED Xm ago] [PASS] check_name ..." and
#     skip the real run.  result_pass drives the summary table.
#   * Cache MISS -> run the check, INSERT (or REPLACE) the result.
#   * ``--no-cache`` -> bypass lookups (writes still happen, so the
#     cache stays current; useful to validate the cache against a
#     fresh cold run without flushing all entries).
#
# Limits intentionally NOT covered by the hash (would create false
# invalidations without improving correctness much):
#   * helper functions in _verify_prototype.py outside the check
#     function itself.  If you change ``_pair_overlap_volume`` you
#     must bust the cache with ``--no-cache`` (or delete the sqlite
#     file).  Refactors of helpers are rare compared to constants /
#     check edits, so this is an acceptable trade-off.
#   * Trimesh / numpy versions.  If you upgrade those, ``--no-cache``
#     once.
