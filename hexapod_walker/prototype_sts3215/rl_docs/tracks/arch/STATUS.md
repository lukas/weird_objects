# arch — Advanced architectures

W&B: tag `track:arch`. Excess-capacity research.

**Goal:** get a more advanced model (GRU/recurrent/temporal) to walk,
stand up, and sit down. What architecture learns the full skill set,
at what budget, with which failure modes.

## Now

- **From-scratch GRU walking CLOSED (08-11, gru-r4c):** both
  pre-registered levers (BPTT window 64→256 steps, hidden 128→256)
  tried and the identical leg-sacrifice/paddle fingerprint survived
  (legs [0,2,3] parked, det gait_valid 0/6) — worse, rise also
  regressed to 0/6 (r3 had it at champion grade). Reward already
  works on the MLP lineage, so this is a capacity/architecture limit,
  not a pricing gap. No further from-scratch GRU variant.
- Frame-stack line passed: hist16 → hist16-dep1 (deploy contract).
- **BC-distill-then-RL-finetune tried (08-11, `cw-arch-gru-bc-ft1`):
  walk survives, stance is MIXED, and a dig-in corrected the root
  cause.** The GRU was BC-distilled from the walk+hold specialists
  (rise was NEVER in the distillation data — the BC parent itself is
  a hold+walk artifact only) then PPO-finetuned 10M steps on a
  walk-heavy mix (60/15/15/10). Result across all four gate+own-DR0.5
  passes: walk gait_valid 6/6 throughout, no paddle at any point in
  10M steps (economy softened, slip/m 2.1-2.6 vs BC parent 1.5);
  lower IMPROVED (4-6/6 vs parent 2/6 det); rise stayed 0/6 (unchanged
  from the BC parent — RL never invented a skill it had zero demos
  for, not forgetting); hold REGRESSED 0/6 det (parent was 6/6 — RL
  genuinely traded hold precision for locomotion polish, real
  forgetting this time). So two different mechanisms in one run:
  data-poverty (rise, never learnable this way) vs erosion (hold,
  actually lost). Keeping `ppo_goal_cw_gru_bc.zip` (md5 864c02fb) as
  the hold+walk reference artifact.

## Next

- Operator-directed next lever for RISE: re-distill stance-heavy +
  DAgger rounds on `distill_gru.py` (give the BC step actual rise
  demos before any further RL) — in progress outside this loop.
- Orchestrator-queued next lever for HOLD (`cw-arch-gru-bc-ft2`,
  2M discovery, launched, same BC parent, lr 3e-4→1e-4 + target-kl
  0.02→0.01, nothing else changed): does a gentler finetune stop RL
  from trading hold for gait polish? Rise is expected to stay 0/6
  regardless (data poverty, not an lr/KL question) — judge this arm
  on hold + walk-cheat-free only.
- Later: contact-from-proprioception aux head; distill specialists
  into one recurrent net.
