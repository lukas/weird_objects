# standwalk — mesh-model stance retrain, then distill into walking

Last updated: 2026-08-25 ~03:3x (operator registration — track
created, nothing launched yet).

## Goal (operator, 08-24 evening)

Retrain the best rising-and-lowering (stance) model on the NEW mesh
MuJoCo model at 100 Hz, then use it as a teacher to distill rise/lower
plus the best walking behavior into one policy. Product: a single
mesh-family 100 Hz policy that, starting from sit, rises, follows a
randomized 60 s joystick session with zero falls, and lowers back.

## Binding constraints (why this is a retrain, not a resume)

- Families do NOT transfer (CURRENT_TRUTHS "SIM MODEL FAMILIES"): the
  legacy stance champion `ppo_goal_cw_stance_dr10` and walk champion
  `ppo_goal_cw_dep_bcgait4_phasedir9_stotight45_seed13` are
  primitive-family 25 Hz policies. NO `respec --from` / warm-start of
  them onto mesh — stage 1 is a recipe rerun on the new model.
- New launches already get `control.hz=100` (launcher-injected) and
  `env.model_source=mesh` (the default) — do not pin legacy values
  here, and never pin `model_source=primitive` in this track.
- Legacy champions MAY be queried as teachers (same obs layout), but
  they carry 25 Hz action scale and primitive dynamics: any
  distillation mechanism must handle the 25->100 Hz gap (query at
  25 Hz + interpolate, distill trajectories, DAgger with rate
  conversion, ...) and must MEASURE whether primitive-trained advice
  is good on mesh dynamics before trusting it.

## Stage 1 — mesh/100 Hz stance retrain (rise + lower)

Recipe basis: the `stance_dr10` lineage recipe (exact cfg in the
ledger/W&B). The rise-reference machinery (`extract_rise_ref.py`,
rise bank) is green as of 08-24. Bank/semantics-check the stance
reward ON MESH before the first launch (mass went 2.104 -> 3.50 kg;
thresholds calibrated on primitive may rank behaviors differently).

GATE (pre-registered): stance panel rise/hold/lower (pod_eval stance
modes), n>=12, det+sto, DR-0 + own-DR: zero falls/tips, quiet hold
(no creep), rise/lower height tracking comparable to the legacy
champion's band. Absolute numbers shift with the +66% mass — the
first passing run's numbers become the recorded mesh reference band.

## Stage 2 — teacher distillation into the best walking model

Use the stage-1 policy as the rise/lower TEACHER. Walking source: the
joystick champion lineage (`stotight45-seed13`) or its mesh-era
successor if the joystick track's in-flight mesh arms produce one
first — either adoption is PRE-REGISTERED here, never a silent
teacher swap (cpg containment rule applies). Mechanism is
cycle-designed (BC clone + RL fine-tune a la bcgait, KL-to-teacher,
phase-scheduled multi-teacher, ...); every mechanism arm pre-registers
its gate and a matched control.

DONE GATE (the track's): ONE mesh-family 100 Hz policy, from sit:
rise -> randomized 60 s joystick command script -> lower to sit.
Zero falls, directions followed, slip/m within the joystick band
(<=~2.9), held-out panel n>=12, det+sto, DR-0 + own-DR.
`eval_joystick_gate` covers the walk segment; the sit->rise->walk->
lower session harness is stage-2 tooling to build.

## Now

Nothing launched. Track registered by the operator 08-24 evening.

## Next

1. Stage-1 arm: pull `stance_dr10`'s exact recipe from the ledger,
   port to mesh@100Hz (no legacy pins), bank-check the stance reward
   on mesh, launch `cw-standwalk-stance-mesh1` (+ seed pair per the
   batching rule).
2. Record the legacy stance champion's primitive-band panel numbers
   in the first triage as the comparison reference; extend pod_eval's
   stance panel for mesh if any flag is missing.
3. After the stage-1 gate: pre-register the stage-2 walking-source x
   mechanism matrix and launch it as a BATCH.

## Landmines

- Sim only — hardware stand/plant transfer stays operator-owned.
- No stage-2 arm may warm-start from a primitive checkpoint.
- The joystick track owns generic mesh walking; this track owns
  rise/lower + the unification. Coordinate via STATUS, don't
  duplicate its mesh conversion arms.
