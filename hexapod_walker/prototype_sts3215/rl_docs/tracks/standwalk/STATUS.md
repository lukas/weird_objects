# standwalk — mesh-model stance retrain, then distill into walking

Last updated: 2026-08-25 ~04:4x (stage-1 bank-checked on mesh +
3-seed batch queued: cw-standwalk-stance-mesh1/-seed1/-seed2).

## Goal (operator, 08-24 evening)

Retrain the best rising-and-lowering (stance) model on the NEW mesh
MuJoCo model at 100 Hz, then use it as a teacher to distill rise/lower
plus the best walking behavior into one policy. Product: a single
mesh-family 100 Hz policy that, starting from sit, rises, follows a
randomized 60 s joystick session with zero falls, and lowers back.

## Binding constraints (why this is a retrain, not a resume)

- Families do NOT transfer (CURRENT_TRUTHS "SIM MODEL FAMILIES"): the
  legacy stance champion `ppo_goal_cw_stance_dr10` and walk champion
  `ppo_goal_cw_dep_bcgait4_phasedir9_stotight45_seed13` are
  primitive-family 25 Hz policies. NO `respec --from` / warm-start of
  them onto mesh — stage 1 is a recipe rerun on the new model.
- New launches already get `control.hz=100` (launcher-injected) and
  `env.model_source=mesh` (the default) — do not pin legacy values
  here, and never pin `model_source=primitive` in this track.
- Legacy champions MAY be queried as teachers (same obs layout), but
  they carry 25 Hz action scale and primitive dynamics: any
  distillation mechanism must handle the 25->100 Hz gap (query at
  25 Hz + interpolate, distill trajectories, DAgger with rate
  conversion, ...) and must MEASURE whether primitive-trained advice
  is good on mesh dynamics before trusting it.

## Stage 1 — mesh/100 Hz stance retrain (rise + lower)

Recipe basis: the `stance_dr10` lineage recipe (exact cfg in the
ledger/W&B). The rise-reference machinery (`extract_rise_ref.py`,
rise bank) is green as of 08-24. Bank/semantics-check the stance
reward ON MESH before the first launch (mass went 2.104 -> 3.50 kg;
thresholds calibrated on primitive may rank behaviors differently).

GATE (pre-registered): stance panel rise/hold/lower (pod_eval stance
modes), n>=12, det+sto, DR-0 + own-DR: zero falls/tips, quiet hold
(no creep), rise/lower height tracking comparable to the legacy
champion's band. Absolute numbers shift with the +66% mass — the
first passing run's numbers become the recorded mesh reference band.

## Stage 2 — teacher distillation into the best walking model

Use the stage-1 policy as the rise/lower TEACHER. Walking source: the
joystick champion lineage (`stotight45-seed13`) or its mesh-era
successor if the joystick track's in-flight mesh arms produce one
first — either adoption is PRE-REGISTERED here, never a silent
teacher swap (cpg containment rule applies). Mechanism is
cycle-designed (BC clone + RL fine-tune a la bcgait, KL-to-teacher,
phase-scheduled multi-teacher, ...); every mechanism arm pre-registers
its gate and a matched control.

DONE GATE (the track's): ONE mesh-family 100 Hz policy, from sit:
rise -> randomized 60 s joystick command script -> lower to sit.
Zero falls, directions followed, slip/m within the joystick band
(<=~2.9), held-out panel n>=12, det+sto, DR-0 + own-DR.
`eval_joystick_gate` covers the walk segment; the sit->rise->walk->
lower session harness is stage-2 tooling to build.

## Now

Stage-1 batch queued 08-25 ~04:4x per the operator kick:
`cw-standwalk-stance-mesh1` + `-seed1`/`-seed2` (3 seeds, one wave per
the batching rule). Recipe: footlow2-lineage joint_goal from scratch
on the mesh default @100 Hz — goal-mix hold=.1/rise=.45/lower=.45,
15 s episodes, DR 0.2, fresh-init field standard (log-std 0, ent
.005), rise-ref tracking + posture/income/finish gates + hold gates +
rise RSI, MESH-recalibrated heights; NO warm start, NO bc_anchor
(primitive-family, families do not transfer), NO endpost shaping
extras (k_stance_clearance/k_end_posture/k_load_even/k_still/
k_current_* all BREAK bank orderings on mesh — measured 08-25:
partial-honest drops below cheats, or k_still pays the refusal).

Stage-1 mesh calibration facts (measured 08-25, this cycle):
- Mesh plant settles at h_rel = **82.96 mm** (primitive tibia-150:
  131.94) => `goal.rise_height_mm=[79,87]`, `actions.max_height_mm=88`.
- The 25 Hz `rise_ref_belly2plant.npz` EXECUTES on mesh: time-aligned
  open-loop replay ends valid plant 3/3 seeds (footprint/attitude/
  support clean). The bank's replay was rate-broken at hz=100
  (advanced one 25 Hz ref row per 100 Hz env step -> 4x-speed rise,
  toppled); fixed test-side (`_ref_row`), training consumer
  (`_rise_ref_clock`) was always time-based.
- Bank-check ON MESH under the exact launch stack: RISE replay 2703
  (plant 3/3) > mesh-honest partial 536 > flagleg 395 > stilt -47 >
  freeze -707 / thrash -1005; LOWER honest 2131 > partial 629 >
  refuse -64 (<0), posture-strict accepts honest / rejects
  outrig+aloft; HOLD quiet 1472 > stepping 870 > flag 50 (quiet
  plants 3/3). Recorded caveats: (a) LOWER thrash seed 2 lucky-
  collapses the 3.5 kg body onto the belly target and banks 1852
  (thrash mean 869 > partial 629, mesh-only) — honest still dominates
  2.4x; triage must watch lower videos for crash-lowering; (b) the
  committed bank's "partial" (primitive j_half row) yields h=1 mm on
  mesh — a mesh partial must hold ref row ~283 (~50 mm), verified.

## Next

1. DONE 08-25 ~04:4x (see Now): recipe ported (option (a): from-
   scratch footlow2-style minus init/bc-anchor), bank-checked on
   mesh, `cw-standwalk-stance-mesh1` + seed pair queued.
   RECIPE ARCHAEOLOGY (08-25 ~04:0x cycle, saves the re-dig):
   `stance_dr10` is PRE-LEDGER (no extra_args entry); its W&B config
   (run `cw-stance-dr10`, 2026-08-08) shows: task `joint_goal`,
   3M steps, warm from `cw-stance-dr08` (ladder even->clear->raisefix
   ->dr08->dr10, DR 0->1.0), init lineage rooted at `init.zip`, and —
   critically — the 6-channel BODY-POSE action space (roll/pitch/
   height/x/y/curl via fixed-foot body IK), NOT the 18-joint space.
   The better-documented stance recipe is the `footlow2` lineage
   (`cw-stand-footlow2-hard1[-s1]`/`-stable1`, full extra_args in the
   ledger, PASS, 4-clause gate incl. eval_session): joint_goal,
   goal-mix hold=0.1,rise=0.45,lower=0.45, rise-ref tracking
   (`reward.rise_ref_path=rl_move/sim/refs/rise_ref_belly2plant.npz`)
   + posture/income gates — but every footlow2 run warm-starts a
   primitive checkpoint and uses `train.bc_anchor_coef=1.0`, both
   impossible on mesh (families do not transfer). So stage-1 needs
   either (a) a from-scratch footlow2-style arm minus init/bc-anchor
   (2M mechanism canary first), or (b) a rerun of the pre-ledger
   discovery ladder. The rise ref is a JOINT-SPACE 25Hz trajectory
   (`q_rad`,`dt=0.04`,`ramp_i0`) extracted from the primitive
   champion (`extract_rise_ref.py` REQUIRES a policy that rises — no
   mesh champion exists yet, so stage-1 must reuse the primitive-
   extracted ref and measure whether it rises the 3.50 kg mesh model;
   the training-side consumer `sim_env._rise_ref_clock` is time-based
   so hz=100 is safe, and the 08-25 bank rate fix (`_ref_row`,
   test_task_semantics.py) makes the bank honest at hz=100 too).
   Mesh current context (hist64-mesh-acq1 dig-in, 08-25): standing
   holds on mesh draw ~0.15 A mean/servo, max 0.41 A (probe_hold_
   current.py, loaded params) — far under the 2.5 A trip, so stance
   itself is NOT current-constrained on mesh; only load-concentrating
   cheats would trip.
2. Record the legacy stance champion's primitive-band panel numbers
   in the first triage as the comparison reference; extend pod_eval's
   stance panel for mesh if any flag is missing.
3. After the stage-1 gate: pre-register the stage-2 walking-source x
   mechanism matrix and launch it as a BATCH.

## Landmines

- Sim only — hardware stand/plant transfer stays operator-owned.
- No stage-2 arm may warm-start from a primitive checkpoint.
- The joystick track owns generic mesh walking; this track owns
  rise/lower + the unification. Coordinate via STATUS, don't
  duplicate its mesh conversion arms.
