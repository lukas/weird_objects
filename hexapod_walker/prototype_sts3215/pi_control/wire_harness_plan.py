"""Per-joint wire-harness reach model for the 18-servo hexapod prototype.

Jun 2026 STS3215 serial-bus refit.  The robot is 18x FEETECH STS3215
**serial-bus** servos on a single half-duplex TTL bus driven directly
by an **Arduino Uno Q** (no PCA9685, no Raspberry Pi, no FE-URT-1 /
Waveshare bus adapter).  Each leg's three servos are **daisy-chained
with stock FEETECH 3-pin bus cables**; the leg's bundle drops through
that leg's ``chassis_bottom`` drop slot into the inter-plate volume,
where it meets the leg's **power branch from the distributed bus bar**
(V+/GND) and the **leg-to-leg data jumper** (signal + GND only).  The
full, buildable wiring plan — the DATA daisy-chain plus the
DISTRIBUTED-POWER bus-bar / per-leg branch harness that keeps any one
Molex 5264 pin under its ~3 A rating — lives in
``../firmware/WIRING.md`` (§6).  See also ``../SHOPPING_LIST.md`` and
``../PROTOTYPE_BOM.md``.

This module is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for the per-joint **cable reach
budget**: "starting from each servo's cradle wire-exit, how long a
bus lead does it take to reach the electronics-tray bus landing,
routing through that leg's drop slot?"  It reads the parametric CAD
geometry (``hexapod_prototype``) and the chassis-frame leg layout
(``hexapod_prototype._leg_chassis_frames``) to generate one
``WIRE_HARNESS_PLAN`` entry per servo:

  * ``joint_idx`` (0 .. 17): canonical joint index.
    ``joint = leg * 3 + axis`` with ``axis in {0=yaw, 1=hip_pitch,
    2=knee}``.
  * ``leg_idx`` (0 .. 5): hex-leg index (0 = +X half north-east,
    going CCW; matches ``_leg_chassis_frames()``).
  * ``axis`` (string): "yaw" / "hip_pitch" / "knee".
  * ``servo_id`` (int 1 .. 18): the bus address assigned to this
    joint (``servo_id = joint_idx + 1``; set once with
    ``feetech_bus.py setid``).  Replaces the retired PWM
    ``pca_board`` / ``pca_channel`` pair — on the serial bus a
    joint is addressed by ID, not by a driver-board channel.
  * ``source_xyz_chassis``: chassis-frame XYZ of the cradle
    wire-exit's mouth (where the harness physically exits the
    servo well).  As of the May 2026 chassis_bottom-integrated
    yaw cradle redesign the YAW cradle's exit is on the cradle's
    -X (radially-inward) face; the legacy ``coxa_bracket`` had
    it on +X.  HIP-PITCH and KNEE cradles still exit on the
    link's +X face, but for path-length estimation we still
    model all three cradles' sources as the YAW exit mouth (see
    ``_cradle_source_bracket_xyz``).
  * ``destination_xyz_chassis``: chassis-frame XYZ of this leg's
    landing post on the electronics-tray **power bus bar + Uno Q
    UART tap** (see ``_bus_landing_chassis_xyz``).  All three
    servos in a leg share that leg's branch terminal, so the
    destination depends only on ``leg_idx``; the per-axis
    difference in reach comes from the slack budget below.
  * ``via_chassis_drop_xyz``: chassis-frame XYZ of the leg's
    drop slot through ``chassis_bottom``
    (= bracket_frame(LEG_HARNESS_DROP_X_CENTRE, 0, 0)).
  * ``path_length_mm_min``: minimum bus-lead length needed to
    span source -> drop -> bus landing, computed as a Manhattan
    distance plus a +30 mm slack-loop budget per joint axis
    the harness physically crosses (see SLACK_BUDGET below).
    Manhattan rather than Euclidean because the harness has
    to follow the drop slot's radial corridor and the tray's
    surface rather than fly diagonally through the chassis.
  * ``extension_required``: human-readable string describing
    the cable build for this joint, computed from
    ``path_length_mm_min`` minus the stock bus-lead length and
    rounded up to the next 30 cm extension cable.

Stock bus lead + extension assumption:

    STS3215 stock bus lead = STOCK_PIGTAIL_MM (declared below).
    Each STS3215 ships with one 3-pin serial-bus cable, and
    SHOPPING_LIST.md calls for a pack of "FEETECH 3-pin serial-bus
    cables, assorted lengths".  We treat the stock lead as
    300 mm = STOCK_PIGTAIL_MM (the longest assorted length), the
    reach available before a leg needs an extra/longer cable.

    Extension cables are 30 cm, 3-pin serial-bus extensions.
    Each adds EXTENSION_LENGTH_MM = 300 mm of reach when wired
    end-to-end with the stock lead.

    extension_required:
      n_ext = max(0, ceil((path_length_mm_min - STOCK_PIGTAIL_MM)
                          / EXTENSION_LENGTH_MM))
      0 -> "STS3215 stock bus lead"
      1 -> "+ 30 cm extension"
      n -> "+ N x 30 cm extensions"

The leg azimuth + chassis-frame transforms come from
``hexapod_prototype._leg_chassis_frames()`` -- DO NOT re-derive
the leg layout here; a future change to leg count / azimuth
must happen in one place.

    """Return the wire-exit 'mouth' position in BRACKET-LOCAL frame
    for one of the three cradle axes.

    As of the May 2026 chassis_bottom-integrated yaw-cradle
    redesign the YAW cradle's wire-exit corridor was mirrored
    to the cradle's -X (radially INWARD) face.  The HIP-PITCH
    and KNEE cradles still exit on the link's +X face -- their
    cradles weren't redesigned -- but for path-length estimation
    we still model all three cradles' sources as the YAW exit
    mouth (= the harness's effective "I'm now in the inter-plate
    volume on the inboard side of the leg" Manhattan node).

    YAW cradle, post-redesign:
      Well-local wire-exit mouth = (-WELL_W/2 - WIRE_SLOT_X_PAST_WALL,
      0, +small) -- i.e. just past the well's -X (inboard) outer
      face, on the centreline, near the cavity floor.
      Transforming that into bracket frame for the YAW cradle:
        bracket-x = body_centre_x + wire_exit_x_well
                  = -SERVO_OUTPUT_X - WELL_W/2 - WIRE_SLOT_X_PAST_WALL
                  ~= -41 mm  (was +21 mm with the legacy +X exit;
                  the new value is INBOARD of the bracket origin)
        bracket-y = 0
        bracket-z = chassis-plate-top + small.  In the new cradle
                    the wire-exit z range is the same well-local
                    band as the legacy bracket, but the cradle
                    floor IS the chassis_bottom top, so the mouth
                    sits roughly at chassis-plate-top + 3 mm of
                    bundle thickness.

    The drop-slot centre is at bracket-x = LEG_HARNESS_DROP_X_CENTRE
    = -46 mm, only 5 mm INBOARD of the new wire-exit mouth -- the
    redesigned cradle shortens the per-leg yaw-cable run by
    ~ |old - new| = |+21 - (-41)| = 62 mm of horizontal Manhattan
    distance compared to the legacy +X bracket exit.  The path-length
    model below picks up this shortening automatically since both
    the source and the destination are computed in chassis frame.

    For the HIP-PITCH and KNEE cradles the well sits in coxa_link
    / femur_link frame at the end of the arm.  We continue to
    model their harness "I'm now at the leg drop slot" position
    as the YAW source for path-length purposes (their physical
    routing follows the parent link inboard to the yaw axis and
    then onto the chassis_bottom top face; the YAW source's chassis
    coords already encode "leg's inboard wire-exit on the chassis"),
    plus a +SLACK_PER_JOINT_CROSSING_MM joint-axis-crossing budget
    each via ``n_crossings()``.  This sidesteps having to derive the
    link-local routing path (which would just add a constant offset
    smaller than the +/-30 mm slack budget anyway) and matches the
    user's "+30 mm slack-loop budget per joint crossing" rule.
