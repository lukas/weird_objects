"""Explicit, world-space registry of every fastener in the hexapod prototype.

This module is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for fastener placement.  Both
the build inspector (``inspect_build.py``) and the verifier
(``_verify_prototype.check_screwdriver_access``) read the same
``build_all_fastener_instances()`` list so a fastener never silently
drifts between the two tools.

Every entry mirrors one bolt-hole / nut-pocket cut that
``hexapod_prototype.py`` makes into a printed part.  The transforms
follow the SAME chain that ``build_prototype_assembly._build_leg`` /
``inspect_build._build_assembly_instances`` use to place each part in
the chassis frame, so adding ``chassis_lift`` to every fastener gives
the world pose used by the build inspector.

Frame
-----

The returned positions and axes live in the **pre-chassis-lift chassis
frame** (z = 0 is the chassis_bottom plate top face).  Callers that
need the lifted / Y-up render frame should apply the same lift /
rotation they apply to every other part.

Convention
----------

* ``head_world_xyz``: the centre of the fastener's HEAD outboard face --
  for an M3 SHCS this is the under-side of the cap (the face that
  bears on the part); for an M3 nyloc nut this is the FACE THAT FACES
  OUTWARD from the part (i.e. the visible outer face of the captive
  nut sitting in its hex pocket).
* ``axis_world``: a unit 3-vector pointing FROM the head INTO the
  material -- the direction you'd push the screw to drive it in.
  For a nut sat outboard of a wall, ``axis_world`` points from the
  outer (visible) nut face INTO the wall.

Enumerated categories (Design B + Design C, May 2026 revert)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. (RETIRED -- STS3215 reconciliation, Jun 2026) The model used to
   emit ``72 x M2.5 case screws`` on the servo OUTPUT face -- an
   invented "front-face 4-bolt case-screw mount" (4 per cradle x 3
   cradles (yaw / hip / knee) per leg x 6 legs = 72).  These were
   PHANTOM: the authoritative Waveshare ST3215 mount-bracket geometry
   shows the output face has NO usable body-mounting screws -- the
   dia-20 disc horn sits on the dia-14 disc-horn bolt cross and covers
   them.  All 72 have been removed.  Servo BODY retention is by printed
   parts only: the yaw servo by ``make_yaw_servo_retainer`` (a strap
   with its own anchor bolts), the hip/knee servos by the clamshell
   ``make_servo_clamp_cap`` (2 x M3 self-tap per joint -- see 14.).
   The output face now carries ONLY the flush disc horn + its 4 x M3
   leg bolts on DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD = 14 mm (see 2.).

2. ``72 x M3 x 6 SHCS`` -- link-to-disc-horn bolts.  4 per joint
   (DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD = 14 mm circle) x (yaw + hip + knee) = 3 joints
   per leg x 6 legs.  Threads downward from the printed link's pad
   face into the 20 mm aluminum 25T DISC horn (Amazon B07D56FVK5)
   that the servo joints drive.  PN_M3X6_SHCS / 91290A111 -- a plain
   M3 SHCS that threads into the disc's M3 TAPPED hole; the aluminium
   IS the thread-engagement medium (no heat-set insert, no self-tap
   into plastic).  June 2026 disc-horn switch: replaced the now-retired
   plastic 4-arm X-horn (PCD 20.8 mm, M2 self-tap) -- see the
   ``DISC_HORN_BOLT_*`` docstrings in ``hexapod_prototype.py``.  The
   M3 x 6 screws ship with the disc kit.

3. ``18 x M2.5 x 8 spline center screw`` -- ships with the servo; sits
   captive between the servo spline and the disc horn.  18 servos
   x 1 screw each = 18.  Special-cased in ``check_screwdriver_access``
   with a SKIP because the screw is hidden under the disc horn during
   normal assembly -- install before fitting the horn.  A Phi
   HORN_CENTRE_OD = 3.4 mm (M3 clearance) hole sits coaxial with the
   joint axis through EVERY driven link's pad:
     * yaw    -- ``centre_hole`` through the coxa_link pedestal cap
     * hip    -- ``hip_centre_hole`` through the femur hip pad (May 2026)
     * knee   -- ``knee_centre_hole`` through the tibia knee pad (May 2026)
   so the spline screw head + a hex driver have line-of-sight from
   the pad's outer face, which is what the user requested for
   serviceability ("the tibia link and femur link round joints need a
   hole in the center to attach the screw into servo behind it", May
   2026).  The skip flag is preserved because the install order is
   still "spline screw FIRST, disc horn SECOND, link THIRD" -- the new
   pad holes are an access-from-above improvement, not a sequence
   change.

4. (retired Aug 2026) -- the 6 M3 x 16 pan-head foot-hinge pins are gone
   with the hinged foot: the TPU ``foot_boot`` presses straight onto the
   tibia CF tube (see ``make_foot_boot``).  No fastener.

5. (retired Aug 2026) -- the 6 M3 nyloc nuts went with the hinge pins
   (4.).  With them gone the build needs NO nut driver and NO Phillips:
   every remaining screw is hex-socket except the M2.5 rear-case
   self-taps and the 4 M2 screen self-taps (off-registry, screen stand).
   Late-Aug 2026 review round 2 adds three more off-registry M3 x 8
   uses on the electronics deck (same 91290A113 stock): 3 screen-stand
   feet (driven UP through the round plate into blind Phi 2.5 self-tap
   pilots -- this closed the old spec gap where the stand's 6 clearance
   holes implied 6 unlisted nuts) and 3 Uno Q mount bolts (down into M3
   thumb nuts, finger-tight; thumb nuts are hand hardware, not a new
   driver).

(May 2026 Design F: the previous categories 4 + 5 -- ``24 x M3 x 32 SHCS``
coxa-bracket-to-chassis bolts and 24 matching M3 nyloc nuts -- have been
RETIRED.  The standalone ``coxa_bracket`` part has been folded into
``chassis_bottom`` as a printed-in cradle, so there is no bracket flange
to clamp through the chassis plates.)

6. ``8 x M3 deck board-mount bolts`` -- Deck redesign (Jun 2026): the
   clip-in battery_holder is RETIRED (the LiPo is now velcro-strapped
   to the top of chassis_bottom through cut strap slots -- no bolts),
   and the stacked electronics deck carries the brain.  4 x M3 x 8 SHCS
   bolt the Arduino Uno Q DOWN onto the lower ``uno_q_tray`` and 4 x M3
   x 8 SHCS bolt the XINGYHENG buck converter DOWN onto the upper
   ``buck_tray``, each threading into an M3 brass heat-set insert in a
   printed tray boss on the board's hole pattern (UNO_Q_HOLES /
   BUCK_HOLES).  Emitted by ``_emit_deck_fasteners``.

7. ``8 x M3 heat-set inserts`` -- one per deck board-mount bolt (see
   6.).  Brass heat-set inserts pressed into the tray bosses.

10. ``8 x M3 x 10 deck standoff-column bolts`` -- Deck redesign
    (Jun 2026).  The two trays stack on 4 M3 brass standoff columns
    rising ABOVE chassis_top on the ``DECK_COLUMN_XY`` (+/-41, +/-33)
    pattern.  4 x M3 x 10 SHCS bolt the ``uno_q_tray`` DOWN onto the
    level-1 columns and 4 x M3 x 10 SHCS bolt the ``buck_tray`` DOWN
    onto the level-2 columns, each threading into the brass standoff's
    female top thread (modeled as a VIRTUAL heat-set-insert engagement
    target, like the chassis standoffs in 18.).  Emitted by
    ``_emit_deck_fasteners``.

11. ``4 x M3 x 8 SHCS`` -- UP from below chassis_top into the lowest
    (level-1) F-F deck standoff columns' female bottom threads at the
    4 ``DECK_COLUMN_XY`` positions (see 10.).  Jul 2026 F/F switch:
    replaces the old male-stud + nyloc retention.

12. (retired Aug 16 2026) -- the 2 switch_holster mount bolts are gone:
    the holster velcros to the flat deck (bosses, inserts, ear, and
    clearance holes all deleted from the CAD).

13. (retired Aug 16 2026) -- the 2 switch_holster heat-set inserts went
    with 12.

14. ``24 x M3 x 8 SHCS`` -- sandwich-joint clamp-cap bolts.  Deck
    redesign (Jun 2026): 2 self-tapping M3 x 8 SHCS per ``servo_clamp_cap``
    drive DOWN through the cap into the cradle ±X wall-end pilots that
    already exist in ``_servo_well_solid``.  12 clamp caps robot-wide
    (1 per hip + knee sandwich joint, 2 per leg x 6 legs) = 24 bolts.
    Emitted by ``_emit_clamp_cap_fasteners`` inside the per-leg loop.

15. (retired) -- the M2.5 Pi board-mount inserts are gone with the
    Raspberry Pi (see 6./10.).

16. (retired) -- the electronics_tray chassis-mount bolts are gone
    with the in-gap electronics_tray (see 6./10.).

17. (retired) -- the chassis_bottom tray-mount heat-set inserts are
    gone with the electronics_tray.

18. ``4 x M3 x 10 SHCS`` -- chassis_top -> brass-standoff bolts.
    Threads DOWN from above chassis_top into the F-F brass
    standoff's female top threads.  4 sites at
    ``HP.CHASSIS_STANDOFF_HOLES_XY`` = (+/-31.1, +/-31.1) mm -- the
    44-mm-radius diagonal pattern (Jul 2026 battery-fit rework:
    moved off (+/-35, 0)/(0, +/-35) so the real 138 x 46 mm LiPo
    has a clear lane through the inter-plate bay).  Modeled
    engagement target is a VIRTUAL SPEC_M3_HEATSET_INSERT entry at
    the top of the standoff (= chassis_top bottom face) so the
    verifier's engagement check pairs the bolt correctly -- the
    actual brass standoff hardware is unmodeled.

19. ``4 x M3 x 14 SHCS`` -- UP from below chassis_bottom (head on the
    -6 mm floor face, through the 8 mm plate + floor stack) into the
    F-F brass standoff's female BOTTOM threads at the same 4 standoff
    XY positions (see 18.).  Jul 2026 F/F switch: replaces the old
    M-F male stud + nyloc, which could not span the 8 mm-thick
    merged chassis_bottom.  Accessible from below the robot.

LATE-AUG 2026 SKU AUDIT (design-review "fastener diet")

Live census from ``build_all_fastener_instances()`` after the TPU-boot,

(The M3 heat-set insert SKU 94459A130 left the build entirely with the
Aug 16 2026 velcro swap -- the 2 switch-holster inserts were the LAST
real inserts; the standoff "insert" entries are virtual engagement
targets, not hardware.)

Verdict: no further merges are free.  Every remaining length is pinned
by an engagement geometry the verifier checks (M3x6 tip clearance,
M3x14 plate span, M3x30 hub stack).  The foot hinge's pan-head
+ nyloc (the last non-hex-key hardware) left with the Aug 2026 boot;
the 2 lone M3x10 holster bolts (the last 91290A114 oddballs outside the
disc-horn stock) left with the Aug 16 2026 velcro swap.

Off-registry (deck, not emitted by this module): 4 x M2 screen
self-taps, and -- review round 2 -- 6 x M3x8 (3 screen-stand feet into
blind pilots + 3 Uno Q bolts into M3 thumb nuts); all draw on stock
already in the BOM, zero new SKUs.

    STS3215 front-face mount (Jun 2026 refit)
    -----------------------------------------
    The DS3225 tab-shelf yaw cradle dropped the servo into an open-top
    bucket and rested its ears on a shelf at chassis-z =
    ``CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2 + CRADLE_TAB_SHELF_Z = +8`` (so the well's
    natural rim, well-local z = WELL_RIM_Z, mapped to +8 and the body
    bottom to +8 - WELL_RIM_Z = -19.25).  The STS3215 cradle
    (``_chassis_yaw_cradle_solid``) instead carries an elevated FRONT
    mount plate and the disc horn seats on top of it; the horn's TOP
    mating face -- where ``coxa_link`` bolts on -- is delivered at the
    pinned ``CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z`` (29.75 mm) so the leg-mount height /
    kinematics are unchanged.

    The well-local frame's origin is the servo body's BACK face
    (``_servo_well_solid``).  Up the front-face stack the disc horn
    seats on the mount PLATE (not on the bare output shaft), so the
    disc-horn TOP sits at well-local z = ``SERVO_BODY_H + WELL_PLATE_T
    + HORN_STACK_H`` above the back face (body height + mount-plate
    thickness + disc-horn stack).  This is the CAD-exact stack-up built
    by ``_chassis_yaw_cradle_solid`` (out_z = CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z -
    CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2, plate_top = out_z - HORN_STACK_H, front_face =
    plate_top - WELL_PLATE_T).  So the Z shift that lands the horn top
    at ``CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z`` is::

        well_to_chassis_dz = CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z
                             - (SERVO_BODY_H + WELL_PLATE_T
                                + HORN_STACK_H)
                           = 29.75 - (34.3 + 4.0 + 5.0) = -13.55 mm

    With this shift the well-local frame coincides EXACTLY with the
    CAD cradle: body back face -> chassis -13.55, body front face (=
    plate underside) -> chassis +20.75, plate top -> +24.75, disc-horn
    top -> +29.75.  The servo body (``_servo_body_world_transform``)
    therefore needs NO extra seat offset, and the printed yaw retainer
    strap (``make_yaw_servo_retainer``) holds the body up against the
    plate (the earlier output-face case screws were a phantom feature
    and have been removed).  NOTE: the disc horn is placed plate-aware
    in ``_horn_world_transform`` (yaw offset uses WELL_PLATE_T, not the
    hip/knee SERVO_OUTPUT_H convention).
