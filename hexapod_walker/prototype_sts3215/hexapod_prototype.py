"""Hexapod walker — PROTOTYPE STL generator for a tabletop, hobby-servo build.

This is a scaled-down sibling of `hexapod_walker.py`.  Same architecture
(regular hex chassis, six identical 3-DOF legs, alternating-tripod
gait), but every dimension is shrunk ~ 6 x and every actuator pocket is
re-shaped for a generic 25 kg-cm hobby servo (DS3225 / MG996R class)
instead of an industrial harmonic-drive servomotor.

Why a separate file?
    The two designs share zero usable geometry: a hobby servo is a
    20 x 40 x 40 mm rectangular brick with two M3 mounting tabs and a
    splined output shaft on top, NOT a 170 mm flanged cylinder.  The
    parts that bolt to it (brackets, links, horn adapters) are
    completely different.  Sharing constants would just make every
    `make_*` function a thicket of `if PROTOTYPE:` branches.

Outputs:

    Generic (DEPRECATED -- Design B retired the printed adapter; see
    HORN_ADAPTER_OD / make_servo_horn_adapter below.  Kept only for
    backward-compatible STL references in old quotes.)
        servo_horn_adapter.stl  -- round printed disc that bolted to a standard
                                   25T spline horn and provided 4 x M3 holes on
                                   a 20.8 mm PCD at 0 / 90 / 180 / 270 deg
                                   (aligned with the now-retired plastic X-horn
                                   arms) so a flat printed link could mate to a
                                   servo horn.  That printed adapter AND the
                                   later plastic X-horn scheme are both retired:
                                   each link now bolts DIRECTLY onto a 20 mm
                                   aluminum 25T disc horn (Amazon B07D56FVK5) via
                                   4 x M3 x 6 SHCS that thread into the disc's
                                   M3 tapped holes on a 14 mm bolt circle.

Geometry overview
-----------------

    Six identical legs spaced 60 deg around a hexagonal body.  Each
    leg has the same 3 rotary DOF as the full-size walker:

         coxa  (hip yaw,    vertical axis)
         femur (hip pitch,  horizontal radial axis)
         tibia (knee pitch, horizontal radial axis)

    18 hobby servos total.  Recommended part: ANNIMOS / Miuzei DS3225
    (25 kg-cm, metal gear, ~$13 each on AliExpress / ~$18 on Amazon).
    The MG996R (10 kg-cm) is also fine for the lighter-weight builds
    but leave less torque margin at the knee.

    Power: 1 x 3S 2200 mAh LiPo (or any 6-7.4 V supply >= 5 A).
    Brain: Arduino Mega + PCA9685 16-channel PWM driver (need 2 boards
    for 18 servos, daisy-chained over I2C).

Build envelope
--------------

    Chassis flat-to-flat:    200 mm
    Foot-to-foot extended:   ~ 700 mm
    Standing height:         ~ 100 mm
    Total mass:              ~ 1.3 kg
    Per-leg static load:     ~ 4.3 N (~ 0.4 kg)
    Peak knee torque:        ~ 0.6 N*m (~ 6 kg-cm) -- DS3225 has 4x margin

# A regular hexagonal 4 mm 3D-printed top + bottom plate, 200 mm flat-to-flat.

                                #     UNDER the belly (see BATTERY_*), so

                                #     The brass standoffs in docs/BOM.md
                                #     are 20 mm to match.  IMPORTANT: any
                                #     future change to CHASSIS_GAP MUST
                                #     re-check the corner-tray headroom +

                                #     (CAD_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md rule #9).
# The TOP plate is intentionally smaller than the bottom plate.  The bottom
# plate is the structural one: it sandwiches the coxa-bracket flanges (with
# their four M3 bolts each) and also takes the per-leg servo body cutouts.
# The TOP plate carries only the battery holder, electronics tray and the
# optional arm bracket -- all of which sit within a ~70 mm radius of the
# chassis centre.  Was 200 mm flat-to-flat to match the bottom; the
# check_workspace_self_collision sweep found that across the full
# (yaw, hip, knee) workspace the coxa_link's hip-pitch well and the
# femur_link's hip pad sweep through z ~ 8..36 mm above the bracket
# flange, which is the same height band the chassis_top occupies
# (chassis_top centre at z = chassis_lift + CHASSIS_TOP_CENTRE_Z, see
#  below).  Shrinking the top plate to
# 140 mm flat-to-flat (= apothem 70 mm) keeps the deck for the battery +
# electronics + arm but moves its outer edge inside the radius the leg
# sweeps reach, eliminating ~95 of the 111 collisions found in the
# pre-fix audit.
CHASSIS_TOP_FLAT_TO_FLAT = 140.0  # mm
# Coaxial-coxa clearance: chassis_top is clipped to a disk of this radius
# so the (now yaw-axis-centred) coxa servo body sweep -- which reaches
# inward to ~60 mm in the chassis_top z-band -- clears the deck edge.  All
# deck mounts sit at r <= 52.6 mm, well inside.  See make_chassis_top.
CHASSIS_TOP_RADIUS = 57.5  # mm
# Aug 2026: the TOP plate is HALF the bottom plate's thickness (user: thin
# enough for screw mounts -- an M3 + nut or short self-tapper clamps
# cleanly through 2 mm).  The plate is non-structural (the deck loads are
# light and the 4 inter-plate standoffs support it at r 44); only the
# switch-holster insert bosses need extra local depth, which they get from
# an under-plate pad (see make_chassis_top).  The plate's UNDERSIDE stays
# where it was (top of the 32 mm standoffs) -- the deck face comes DOWN
# 2 mm.  All placement math must use the constants below, never
# CHASSIS_PLATE_T, for the top plate.
CHASSIS_TOP_T        = CHASSIS_PLATE_T / 2.0                    # 2 mm
CHASSIS_TOP_BOT_Z    = CHASSIS_GAP + 0.5 * CHASSIS_PLATE_T      # +34 underside
CHASSIS_TOP_CENTRE_Z = CHASSIS_TOP_BOT_Z + 0.5 * CHASSIS_TOP_T  # +35 (mesh z=0)
CHASSIS_TOP_TOP_Z    = CHASSIS_TOP_BOT_Z + CHASSIS_TOP_T        # +36 deck face

# ---- Leg link lengths -----------------------------------------------------
# Same 1 : 4 : ~5 ratio as the full-size walker, scaled for a tabletop
# build.  Tibia is intentionally a hair longer than 4 x coxa so the
# foot can lift clear over a small obstacle in swing phase.
COXA_LENGTH    =  12.5   # mm -- yaw axis -> hip-pitch axis.  Set to
                         # SERVO_OUTPUT_X so the hip servo BODY centres
                         # over the yaw axis: the hip cradle stacks
                         # coaxially RIGHT ON TOP of the yaw hub (Part A)
                         # instead of cantilevering off to the side.
FEMUR_LENGTH   =  90.0   # mm -- hip-pitch axis -> knee axis
# Knee axis → foot tip (kinematic).  Bench measure of CF span from the
# distal face of ``tibia_knee_yoke`` to the foot tip: legs 1/2/3/5 ≈ 128 mm,
# legs 0/4 ≈ 124 mm.  Model uses 128 mm (was 130).  Short legs print
# ``extra_stl/foot_boot_plus4.stl`` (+4 mm longer solid tip) so all six
# reach the same 128 mm tip with the same tube-end press fit.
# TRANSITIONAL (late-Aug 2026 review round 2): the plus4 variant only
# exists to absorb an as-built tube-cutting error.  Next time tubes are
# cut, make all six 128 mm, set SHORT_CF_LEG_INDICES = (), and retire
# foot_boot_plus4 + its tool -- one boot SKU for the whole robot.
TIBIA_LENGTH   = 128.0   # mm -- knee axis -> foot tip
SHORT_CF_LEG_INDICES = (0, 4)   # 4 mm short CF; use foot_boot_plus4
FOOT_BOOT_SHORT_EXTRA = 4.0     # mm -- longer boot tip for SHORT_CF_LEG_INDICES

# ---- Coxa link pedestal --------------------------------------------------
# How far above the disc-horn mating face the coxa-link arm + well
# float on a built-in pedestal.  Without the lift the hip-pitch well
# bottom sits ~2.5 mm below the chassis-plate top and the femur's
# hip-pad swings into the bracket flange + well as the femur pitches.
#
# Sizing constraint:  the femur's hip pad/neck is a CYLINDER of radius
# HIP_PAD_R = 17 mm rotating about the +Y joint axis.  The lowest
# coxa-link z it reaches under rotation is hip_drop - HIP_PAD_R =
# -(WELL_D/2 + arm_t/2) + COXA_LIFT - 17 mm; the bracket's flange
# TOP face sits at world z = BRACKET_FLANGE_T = 15 mm (the flange
# was thickened so a solid top cap closes off the body+tab passage --
# see BRACKET_FLANGE_T below), which equals coxa-link z =
# -yaw_output_z + BRACKET_FLANGE_T = -10.75 mm in the standing pose.
# Setting (lowest pad z in coxa-link) >= -10.75 mm gives
#   COXA_LIFT >= BRACKET_FLANGE_T + WELL_D/2 + arm_t/2
#                + HIP_PAD_R - yaw_output_z
#              = 15 + 14.5 + 3 + 17 - 25.75 = 23.75 mm.
# COXA_LIFT = 26 mm gives ~ 2.25 mm of safety margin against FDM
# print tolerances and the voxel sampler's pitch (1.5 mm).  Was 14 mm
# when the flange was a thin 4 mm slab with a through-slot for the
# body+tab passage; bumping the flange to a solid 15 mm slab (with
# the body cavity as a one-sided pocket open only on the bottom of
# the flange and a small Phi 11 mm gear clearance through the top
# cap) requires the matching COXA_LIFT bump so the femur's swept hip
# pad still clears the taller flange.
#
# Bolt screws need to be ~M3 x 32 mm long to reach through the
# (taller) pedestal + disc horn into the servo's
# output gear.  The pedestal's structural Z extent is unchanged
# (still 3.5 mm; the lift increases the air gap below the structural
# slab, not the slab itself).
# COXA_LIFT history:
#   COXA_LIFT = 14 was the original value with a thin 4 mm bracket flange
#   and HIP_PAD_R = 17.  Bumping the flange to a solid 15 mm slab (so a
#   top cap closes the body+tab passage) required COXA_LIFT = 26 to keep
#   the femur's swept hip pad clear of the thicker flange.
#
#   Bumping HIP_PAD_R from 17 to 19.5 (so the hollow-annulus neck has a
#   printable 3 mm wall around the horn-stack clearance void -- see the
#   HIP_PAD_R docstring) puts the pad's swept disk +Z edge at
#       hip_drop + HIP_PAD_R = -17.5 + COXA_LIFT + 19.5 = COXA_LIFT + 2 mm
#   which would COLLIDE with the coxa-link arm's bottom face at z =
#   COXA_LIFT (the arm rests directly on the pedestal top, so arm-bottom
#   and pedestal-top share the COXA_LIFT plane).
#
#   We FIRST drop the well 4 mm deeper than the "arm-bottom = well-top"
#   default (WELL_Z_DROP_EXTRA = 4 mm; see below) so the hip axis lives
#   4 mm below arm-bottom and the pad's +Z edge drops by 4 mm relative
#   to the arm.  This gives 2 mm of vertical air between the pad's +Z
#   edge and the arm's bottom face.
#
#   We THEN bump COXA_LIFT to 32 mm so the pad's -Z edge (hip_drop -
#   HIP_PAD_R = COXA_LIFT - 21.5 - 19.5 = COXA_LIFT - 41 mm) still clears
#   the coxa-bracket flange's top face (at coxa-link z = -10.75 mm in the
#   standing pose).  COXA_LIFT = 32 mm gives:
#     pad -Z edge = -9.5 mm > -10.75 mm  (1.25 mm clearance to bracket)
#     pad +Z edge = +30.5 mm < +32 mm    (1.50 mm clearance to arm)
#   Both clearances are sized for FDM print tolerance + voxel sampler
#   pitch (1.5 mm) so check_workspace_self_collision stays clean.
#
#   Design B (May 2026): the printed servo_horn_adapter has been
#   retired, dropping HORN_STACK_H from 9 mm to 5 mm and therefore
#   dropping the world Z of the coxa_link's frame (and the hip-pitch
#   joint axis) by HORN_ADAPTER_T = 4 mm.  Without compensation, the
#   bracket's flange top in coxa-link Z moves from -10.75 mm to
#   -6.75 mm and the femur's swept pad (lowest coxa-link z = -9.5 mm)
#   now collides with it by ~ 2.75 mm.  COXA_LIFT is therefore bumped
#   by the same 4 mm (32 -> 36) so the hip-pitch joint axis stays at
#   the same WORLD Z as before, the kinematic chain is unchanged for
#   RL / gait / MuJoCo, and the documented +1.25 mm bracket and
#   +1.5 mm arm clearances are restored.
#
# STS3215 refit (Jun 2026): the FEETECH STS3215 body is 24.8 mm deep
# vs the 20 mm Design-B hobby body -- +4.8 mm.  That +4.8 mm shows up
# TWICE in the cap-facing direction: the body's depth half-span about
# the hip-pitch axis grows +2.4 mm (+/-10 -> +/-12.4) AND the well drops
# +2.4 mm deeper (WELL_D 29 -> 33.8, so well_z_drop = -(WELL_D/2 + ...)
# gets 2.4 mm more negative).  Net, the body's lower (cap-facing) edge
# falls a full 4.8 mm, from coxa-link z ~ +4.5 to ~ -0.3, punching it
# through the 4 mm disc-horn bolt cap (z in [0, 4]), which must keep its
# full PEDESTAL_CAP_T for the M3 SHCS counterbores.  Following the exact
# same pattern as the Design-B bump, COXA_LIFT is raised by that same
# +4.8 mm (36 -> 41) so the hip axis (and the rigidly attached servo
# body) lifts back up, restoring body_bot ~ +4.7 mm and the cap
# clearance, while the assembly keeps the world hip-axis Z fixed so
# kinematics / RL / MuJoCo are unchanged.
COXA_LIFT     = 41.0     # mm  (32 -> 36 Design B -> 41 STS3215 refit)

# Extra drop of the hip-pitch well centre BELOW the natural "arm-bottom =
# well-top" plane.  When 0, the well's +Z face (= the hip-pitch axis +
# WELL_D/2) coincides with the arm's bottom face and the bridge member
# is a thin 0.5 mm boolean kiss.  When > 0, the well sits this many mm
# deeper, the hip axis drops by the same amount, and the bridge box
# extends DOWN to overlap the new well-top.  Used to keep the femur hip
# pad's swept +Z edge clear of the coxa-link arm's bottom face -- see
# COXA_LIFT docstring for the geometry.
WELL_Z_DROP_EXTRA = 4.0  # mm

# See COXA_HIP_DROP below for the derived hip-axis Z position.  It needs
# WELL_D and COXA_ARM_T (defined later) so it lives further down.

# ---- Servo (actuator): FEETECH STS3215 serial-bus servo ------------------
# ST-3215-C018, 12 V / 30 kg-cm.  June 2026 redesign replaced the DS3225
# PWM servo (and its 2x PCA9685 drivers + AS5600 add-on encoders) with the
# STS3215 smart serial-bus servo: a single TTL bus, built-in 12-bit
# magnetic-encoder feedback, no PWM boards, no external sensors.
#
# Geometry verified against FEETECH's OFFICIAL STEP (SO-ARM100
# STS3215_03a.step): a rectangular brick 45.4 (X, long) x 24.8 (Y, depth),
# the 25T output shaft on the +Z face offset +12.5 mm in X, an idler shaft
# on the -Z face (the "dual-axis" case), M3 central horn screw.
#
# CRUCIAL MOUNTING DIFFERENCE: the STS3215 has NO protruding mounting tabs.
# It bolts via 4x M2.5 THREADED HOLES IN ITS METAL CASE, present on BOTH
# the front (output) and back (idler) faces, on a SERVO_MOUNT_SQUARE = 9.8
# mm square around the shaft axis (STEP: holes at (12.5 +/- 4.9, +/- 4.9)).
# The printed cradle bolts to the FRONT face: 4x M2.5 pass through the
# cradle's output-side plate into the case (the case IS the thread -- so
# the old heat-set inserts, Phi 8 mm bosses and self-tap pilots are all
# DELETED).  The horn screws onto the 25T spline with the central M3.
SERVO_BODY_W      = 45.4   # mm -- body length along the output-offset (X) axis
SERVO_BODY_D      = 24.8   # mm -- body depth (Y, perpendicular)
SERVO_BODY_H      = 34.3   # mm -- back mount-face -> front(output) mount-face (Z),
                            #      i.e. between the two 4x M2.5 hole planes (STEP)

# --- Wire-exit boot on the servo body (LEGACY STAND-IN) --------------------
# IMPORTANT (Aug 2026 — see firmware/WIRING.md "Where the wires leave an
# STS3215"): the REAL STS3215 has two recessed Molex 5264 ports on the
# BACK (idler) face, centre/−X half, with cables leaving out the back —
# not a DS3225-style molded boot on the +X short end.  These WIRE_BOOT_*
# constants (and the box on ``make_servo_body``) are a DS3225-era probe
# target kept so cradle insertion / clearance channels still have a
# geometric stand-in.  Do NOT treat them as the STS3215 cable exit for
# harness routing — BuildViz attaches at the back-face port cluster
# (``_servo_attach_paths`` in tools/full_robot_viz_build.py).
#
# Stand-in geometry in servo-local coords (origin = back/bottom face centre,

#         Z span : [WIRE_BOOT_Z_BASE, WIRE_BOOT_Z_BASE + WIRE_BOOT_H]
#     boot extrudes OUT in +X by WIRE_BOOT_PROTRUSION from the body face
#         (so boot occupies x in [+SERVO_BODY_W/2, +SERVO_BODY_W/2 + WIRE_BOOT_PROTRUSION]).
WIRE_BOOT_W           = 7.0    # mm -- stand-in boot Y width  (centred on y = 0)

# RESOLVED (Aug 2026): 12.5 mm is CORRECT — do not resurrect the old
# "Waveshare bracket ~3.6 mm" note.  Besides the FEETECH SO-ARM100 STEP,
# the ASSEMBLED robot proves it: the front-face M2.5 mount square at
# (12.5 +/- 4.9, +/- 4.9), the Phi 20 horn-cap wells in every cradle lip,
# and the yaw drive-nub M3 horn screws (fed down the coxa head-access
# shafts, bench-torqued) all land on the real servos — impossible if the
# true offset were ~3.6.  The 3.6 figure was a misreading of a Waveshare
# 2D bracket drawing (measured from a bracket feature, not the body
# centre).  The END-face body-bolt pattern below is centred on the BODY
# and is independent of this offset either way.

# --- Leg pitch-joint output-axis convention --------------------------------
# The hip + knee sandwich joints' OUTPUT (disc-horn) axis is coxa-local
# +/-Y.  Choosing -Y points every cradle's OPEN (servo-insertion) face --
# and therefore its bolt-on clamp cap -- UP (+Z), so the cradle's solid
# back seats DOWN onto its mount (the hub platform for the hip, the femur
# spine for the knee).  This is what lets the hip bracket stack coaxially
# on top of the yaw hub: the wide servo would otherwise open its mouth
# DOWN into the hub and leave no room to bolt the foot.  The leg POSE is
# unchanged -- femur_dir / tibia_dir and all joint points are computed
# geometrically and are independent of this sign; only the cradle/yoke
# ORIENTATION (which way the open face points) flips.

# besides the 9.8 mm M2.5 square around the output, the plastic case shell
# carries FOUR small (Phi 1.5 molded pilot, ~1.5 mm deep) screw holes on
# EACH mount face -- the same family the yaw saddle self-taps on the REAR
# face (``yaw_rear_screw_centres`` / SADDLE_CASE_HOLE_*).  Body-frame (x from
# body centre, y depth) positions:
#     REAR  (passive) face: (4.2, +-10.25) and (-20.3, +-10.25)

# SERVO_FRONT_CASE_DECK_DROP below the front mount-hole plane (STEP: shell
# deck z=15.9 vs mount plane z=18.7), so a screw through the well lip

# ---- STS3215 BODY-retention bolts on the END (+/-X) faces -----------------
# Measured from the authoritative Waveshare ST3215 mount brackets: each
# END (short, +/-X) face of the servo carries 4x M2.5 threaded holes in a
# 10 x 10 mm square CENTRED on the face (clearance dia 2.8 through the
# printed part).  These are the REAL body-mounting holes (distinct from
# the dia-14 disc-horn cross on the OUTPUT face), so the printed cradles
# can POSITIVELY bolt the servo by its end face instead of only gripping
# it.  The square is centred on the body face, so the hole centres are
# independent of the output offset (SERVO_OUTPUT_X): in the body frame
# (centre at x=y=0, z in [0, SERVO_BODY_H]) they sit at
#   (+/-SERVO_BODY_W/2, +/-SERVO_BODY_BOLT_PITCH/2, SERVO_BODY_H/2 +/-
#    SERVO_BODY_BOLT_PITCH/2)
# i.e. y = +/-5, z = SERVO_BODY_H/2 +/- 5 on each end face.  See
# ``servo_end_face_bolt_centres``.

SERVO_BODY_BOLT_LEN     = 8.0   # mm -- M2.5 x 8 screw into the servo case
# The printed end WALLS are thick (WELL_WALL_X ~ 8-11 mm), so the M2.5
# head is recessed in a counterbore and the screw stands off the servo
# end face by (SERVO_BODY_BOLT_LEN - SERVO_MOUNT_THREAD_DEPTH) so its tip
# threads SERVO_MOUNT_THREAD_DEPTH into the case.  Keeps a stock M2.5 x 8.

# ---- Bearing-SANDWICH joint architecture (Jun 2026 -> symmetric refit) ----
# Real STS3215 legged-robot joints are supported on BOTH ends, not
# cantilevered off the output horn.  The STS3215 already gives us TWO
# coaxial bearing-supported bosses: the 25T DRIVEN spline on the front
# (output) face, and a SMOOTH idler boss on the back face that rotates with
# the output shaft on the servo's own internal rear bearing.  So instead of
# adding an external 688 ball bearing + housing on the back (an asymmetric
# "ring" that only supported the yoke through a loose stub), we mount a
# SECOND disc horn -- the PASSIVE horn -- on the rear idler boss and bolt the
# moving yoke to BOTH horns identically.  The result is a symmetric, fully
# bolted bearing sandwich carried on the servo's own two bearings:
#
#   * DRIVEN side  : STS3215 25T spline -> dia-20 disc horn -> yoke top arm
#                    (4x M3 into the horn's tapped holes + central spline
#                     screw).
#   * PASSIVE side : rear idler boss -> centering ADAPTER -> a SECOND dia-20
#                    disc horn -> yoke bottom arm (4x M3 + a central
#                    retention screw into the rear boss so the horn can't
#                    work loose).  Same horn part, same bolt pattern, same
#                    reach-down pad -- the yoke arms are mirror-identical.
#   * SEGMENTS     : dia-8 CARBON-FIBRE TUBE between joints (femur / tibia),
#                    socketed into printed end-fittings.
SERVO_MOUNT_SELFTAP_OD    = 2.6   # mm -- printed-plate clearance for M2/M2.5 self-tap
SERVO_CASE_HOLE_OD        = 2.5   # mm -- molded case hole the self-tapper bites (STEP)

# --- Passive (rear-boss) horn stack -----------------------------------------
# Jul 2026 (user): the STS3215 ships with a STOCK METAL PASSIVE HORN that
# looks just like the driven disc horn (same 4-hole pattern the yoke bolts
# to).  Its centre bore slides OVER the rear idler boss, so the horn seats
# FLUSH on the servo back face and does NOT protrude beyond the boss tip.
# The boss itself centres the horn; the printed centering adapter
# (make_passive_horn_adapter, retired here) and its 2 mm standoff base are
# GONE, which pulls the yoke bottom-arm seat 2 mm closer to the servo (the
# user measured the adapter-era yoke exactly 2 mm too wide on this stack).
# (Derived constants that depend on the disc-horn dimensions live in the
# JOINT_HORN block below, once those are defined; see BACK_STACK_DEPTH /
# PASSIVE_HORN_FACE_Z there.)
REAR_BOSS_H        = SERVO_OUTPUT_H               # 2 mm -- rear idler boss protrusion
REAR_BOSS_OD       = 4.0                          # mm -- smooth rear boss/shaft dia (MEASURE
                                                  #       on your unit); the stock passive
                                                  #       horn's centre bore rides it directly.

# ===== SPACED YAW BEARING PAIR (cantilever moment support) ===============
# The coxa cantilevers the whole hip/femur/tibia ~COXA_LENGTH out to the
# side of the yaw axis.  A SINGLE thin bearing reacts shear but barely
# reacts the tilting MOMENT (its internal couple is only ~its width).  We
# instead use TWO coaxial deep-groove bearings SPACED apart along the yaw
# axis: tilt stiffness scales with the spacing^2, so the cantilever moment
# is carried into chassis_bottom as an axial couple, not through the servo
# spline/horn.
#
# Geometry cost: a single 6706 fits the original 5 mm disc-horn gap, but a
# spaced pair needs vertical room ABOVE the disc horn (the servo body
# blocks any bearing below the output face).  We therefore LOWER the yaw
# output plane and LIFT the hip the same amount (YAW_TOWER_RAISE) so the
# WORLD hip-pitch axis Z is unchanged -> leg kinematics / RL / MuJoCo are
# unchanged (same trick the COXA_LIFT history used).  See CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z
# and COXA_HIP_DROP below.
YAW_TOWER_RAISE           = 14.5  # mm -- yaw output lowered / hip lifted by this
                                  #       (Jun 2026: bumped 9 -> 14.5 = +5.5 when
                                  #       BOTH yaw bearings moved above the flush

# same 7 mm centre-to-centre moment-couple spacing the old 4+3+4 stack had,
# so tilt stiffness is preserved while the stack grows only 3 mm.  The
# Phi 25 bore still clears the Phi 20 drive-bolt pattern (head counterbores

# Forensic finding: the single-piece tower bored 37 -> 34 -> 37 -> 34 (two
# Phi 37 race pockets each trapped between Phi 34 constrictions), so NEITHER
# 6706 outer race could reach its seat from any direction -- a captured
# pocket the static-assembly CAD never flagged.  The tower is now SPLIT at
# the lower race's top face (coxa-local z = YAW_BEARING_LOWER_TOP_Z = -1):
#
#   * BOTTOM tower (integral to chassis_bottom): an OPEN-TOP Phi 37 pocket
#     from the mount-plate shoulder (z = -5) up to the split (z = -1).  The
#     LOWER race drops straight down onto the z = -5 shoulder -- a clear,
#     monotone Phi 37 insertion path with no constriction above it.
#   * yaw_bearing_cap (NEW bolt-on part, x6): carries the UPPER race in an
#     OPEN-TOP Phi 37 pocket seated on a neck shoulder at z = +2 (clear Phi 37
#     path from above), and a Phi 34 neck whose bottom face (z = -1) caps the
#     lower race once the cap is bolted down.  The old Phi 34 retaining lip
#     over the upper race is RETIRED (it was the very constriction that
#     trapped the race); the upper outer race is now located by the z = +2
#     gravity shoulder and the rotating hub's upper inner-race flange above.
#
# 3 x M3 self-tap join bolts (YAW_CAP_BOLT_*) pull the cap down onto the
# tower.  All join hardware lives BELOW the rotating dust-lip band
# (coxa-local z < YAW_HUB lip z0 = +3.5) so it never fouls the turntable.
# (Jun 2026: the bottom register wrap-lip was removed -- it was flimsy and
# hard to print; concentricity now comes from the 3 bolts into the tower
# pilots, which are coaxial by construction with the bottom-tower ear bosses.)
# Aug 2026 6805 swap: the split plane is FROZEN at the legacy +4.5 (lower-

# ---- Heat-set brass insert for cradle servo mounts (May 2026) -----------
# McMaster 94459A130: M3 brass heat-set insert, knurled.  Pilot Phi 4.0 mm,
# insert OD 5.7 mm (knurled max), insert length 5.0 mm, recommended pilot
# depth 6.0 mm.  Installed with a soldering iron at ~220 deg C, light
# pressure, ~10-15 s per insert.  After install the M3 x 8 SHCS threads
# into the insert from above; the bolt clamps the servo ear down onto
# the boss top surface.
#
# This replaces the earlier "M3 self-tap into Phi 2.5 mm plastic pilot"
# scheme.  The user's audit (May 2026) found that 7 of 12 cradle bolt
# sites had 0.00-1.50 mm of plastic on one side of the Phi 2.5 mm pilot
# in the Y direction -- the cradle outer walls did not extend in Y
# beyond the body footprint, and on the +X column the wire channel ate
# into the wall right where the bolt lived.  The verifier's vertical
# self-tap check (commit b447f88) only confirmed that the pilot
# CYLINDER existed; it never confirmed that the pilot was SURROUNDED
# by enough material radially, so the structural bug shipped.
#
# Switching to a heat-set insert (a) gives real metal threads (replacing
# the borderline thread engagement that the Phi 2.5 mm plastic pilot
# provided in PLA / PA12), (b) requires a Phi 4 mm pilot which is
# physically wider than the previous Phi 2.5 mm pilot's column anyway,
# and (c) gives us license to add a fat Phi ~8 mm boss around each
# pilot so the radial-engagement bug automatically vanishes.  The

# Chassis_bottom yaw cradle channel-side wall-reduction exemption
# (May 2026, commit 5.5/9)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# For the LEGACY cradles (coxa_bracket / coxa_link / femur_link) the
# 2 -X heat-set bosses sit on a column with NO wire-cut intrusion
# (the L-corridor exits +X, the boot channel cuts +X, and the -X
# wall is solid).  The verifier's radial-material probe in
# ``check_cradle_insert_pockets`` requires ALL 32 azimuths sampled
# at r = CRADLE_BOSS_OD/2 - CRADLE_BOSS_MIN_WALL_MM/2 = 3.5 mm to
# be inside boss material -- 0/32 air-flagged is the strict
# (pre-2026) tolerance these cradles continue to enforce.
#
# The NEW chassis_bottom integrated yaw cradle (commit 1/9 +
# commit 5.5/9) mirrors the wire-exit L-CORRIDOR to the -X
# (radially-inward) face so the servo harnesses route to the
# per-leg drop slot at chassis-frame (+46.8, +27, +2) without
# crossing the chassis centre line.  That mirror puts the
# corridor's lateral leg through the -X bosses' inner azimuth
# band (corridor y in [-3.5, +3.5], boss y at +/-5 with OD = 8 mm
# = boss y range [+1, +9] and [-9, -1]); the corridor cut carves
# away the inboard ~25 percent of each -X boss circumference --
# specifically the 8/32 azimuths in [3 pi/4, 5 pi/4] facing the
# cradle interior, where the corridor reaches the boss radius.
#
# Engineering rationale for accepting the wall reduction
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Heat-set retention in printed plastic is dominated by the
# knurl-ring's AXIAL bite into the plastic surrounding the
# insert (the knurl teeth dig into the boss wall as the insert
# is pressed in hot, then anneal in place).  With 75 percent
# (24/32) of the boss circumference RETAINED at full
# 1.5 mm-min radial wall thickness AND the chassis_bottom plate
# bonded to the boss BOTTOM (the boss grows out of the plate
# top face via union, so the plate provides full axial
# retention on the boss bottom plane), losing 25 percent of the
# radial knurl coverage costs approximately 25 percent of the
# pull-out force -- a McMaster 94459A130 brass insert is rated
# for ~250 N pull-out at full coverage in PA-CF, so the
# channel-side reduction degrades that to ~190 N.  Each
# servo-tab clamp bolt sees < 30 N tensile load under the
# worst-case yaw-actuator stall torque (DS3225 stall ~25 kg-cm
# = 2.45 N-m, divided over 4 bolts at SERVO_TAB_HOLE_PCD/2 =
# 24.75 mm lever arm gives 24.7 N per bolt; doubled to 50 N
# for shock loading), so 190 N retention leaves 3.8 x safety
# factor on the worst-loaded insert (a 5 x margin is the
# conventional target -- close enough for a prototype with
# bolted redundancy on both -X sites).
#
# The verifier's ``check_cradle_insert_pockets`` applies a
# CASE-SPECIFIC azimuth tolerance: 0/32 strict for the legacy
# link cradles (no wire intrusion on the boss column) and
# 8/32 (= 25 percent) for the chassis_bottom yaw cradle inserts
# (channel intrusion documented above).  Globally lowering
# CRADLE_BOSS_MIN_WALL_MM would weaken the legacy cradles
# unnecessarily, so the relaxation is kept localised to the
# one case that physically requires it.
#
# See the ``_wire_exit_l_corridor`` / ``_boot_clearance_channel``
# function docstrings (in the cradle helpers section below) for
# the geometric split that motivated the chassis_bottom redesign
# and the per-call-site mirror policy that enforces these
# tolerances.

# ---- +X cradle bolts: SELF-TAP fallback (mixed-mode Design E, May 2026) --
# The 2 +X cradle bolts at (sx, sy) = (+1, +/-1) CANNOT use the heat-set
# scheme above: the M3 brass insert wants a Phi 8 mm boss centred at
# (+24.75, +/-5), spanning well-z [17, 27], and that boss footprint
# intersects the inside-+X-wall WIRE CHANNEL (y in +/-3.5) that the
# servo's molded wire-exit boot has to pass through DURING INSERTION.
# The boot is WIRE_BOOT_W = 7 mm wide in Y so the channel CANNOT be
# narrowed in Y to clear the boss; the M3 bolt CANNOT be moved in Y
# because it has to drop through the DS3225's factory-drilled tab hole
# at the fixed servo SERVO_TAB_HOLE_PCD_Y = +/-5 offset; and the bolt
# CANNOT be moved in X for the same factory-tab-hole reason.  So the
# heat-set scheme is physically incompatible with the wire-exit
# channel on the +X column.
#
# The user explicitly accepted reverting these 2 bolts to the original
# Phi 2.5 mm M3 SELF-TAP pilot scheme to unblock servo seating
# ("Maybe we need to go back to just drilling the screws into the
# mounts on the servos if the heat set insert wont fit with the
# channels added").  This trades pull-out durability on these 2
# specific bolts for being able to assemble the robot at all; the
# 2 -X bolts per cradle still use the heat-set insert (no channel
# conflict there), so half of the structural improvement from
# f03d59b survives.  See ``check_cradle_insert_pockets`` in
# ``_verify_prototype.py`` for the mixed-mode probe -- only the -X
# sites are checked for 1.5 mm radial wall material; the +X sites
# are documented as known-thin (0.25 mm on the channel side) and
# the radial check is skipped there.  See also
# ``check_servo_insertion_path`` which probes the boot's swept
# volume through the +X wall during insertion so this exact
# regression cannot ship again.
#
# Pilot geometry mirrors the original pre-f03d59b SHCS_PILOT_OD
# value (= 2.5 mm) and runs from the shelf top down by
# INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_PILOT_DEPTH so the M3 x 8 SHCS engages 5+ mm
# of plastic below the 2.5 mm-thick servo tab.  No boss is added
# around the self-tap pilot -- the existing well wall material
# carries the surrounding plastic, and adding a boss would only
# enlarge the column's footprint without solving the inboard
# (channel-side) wall problem.

# ---- Servo wire-exit slot ------------------------------------------------
# On DS3225 / MG996R / DS3218-class hobby servos the 3-wire harness is
# rigidly moulded into the back-case at the BOTTOM-OUTBOARD corner of
# the body -- specifically the corner where the back case meets the -X
# short-end face (the end OPPOSITE the output spline).  The bundle is
# glued in place, so the servo physically cannot seat in the cradle
# unless that exact corner is open.  The harness then leaves the cradle
# either by routing straight DOWN out of the corner (through the well
# floor) or by routing HORIZONTALLY out the body's -X short-end face
# (through the bottom of the -X wall).  To support both escape paths
# with one boolean cut we put an L-shaped channel at the well's -X
# bottom-outboard corner -- a single rectangular box that punches
# through the floor at the body's -X end AND through the bottom of
# the -X wall above it.
#
# Slot geometry (well-local frame -- see _wire_exit_slot for details):
#     X / Z: use WIRE_SLOT_X_INBOARD, WIRE_SLOT_X_PAST_WALL, WIRE_SLOT_DEPTH,
#            WIRE_SLOT_Z_BELOW_FLOOR for a larger exit than the old 12 x 6 x 8.5
#            mm box so bundled + jacketed harnesses fit.
#     Y: WIRE_SLOT_W stays ~6 mm (symmetric) so M3 pilots at well-y = +/-5 keep
#        ~1+ mm clearance; open more in X/Z instead.
#     Stays well below WELL_RIM_Z so tab-screw seats stay solid.
WIRE_SLOT_W     = 7.0   # mm wide along the body SHORT axis (well Y).  Pilot
                        # columns at y = +/-5 have radius 1.25 mm, so their
                        # inner edges sit at y = +/-3.75; a 7 mm slot has its
                        # edges at y = +/-3.5, leaving 0.25 mm of Y clearance
                        # to the pilots.  Going wider than 7.5 mm starts
                        # punching into the M3 thread engagement zone.
WIRE_SLOT_DEPTH = 13.5  # mm reach UP into the +X wall above the cavity
                        # floor.  Sized so the WIRE_BOOT_* envelope plus
                        # any bent harness above it clears the slot top.
                        # Still well below WELL_RIM_Z (27.25), so M3
                        # pilot tab seats at the rim are untouched.
WIRE_SLOT_X_PAST_WALL = 4.0   # mm beyond outer +X well face for exit
WIRE_SLOT_X_INBOARD   = 2.5   # mm inside cavity +X body face for opening
WIRE_SLOT_Z_BELOW_FLOOR = 4.0  # mm below outer floor for thick boots

# Vertical channel cut into the inside surface of the +X cavity wall so the
# 3-wire harness has a place to lie flat against the wall as it descends to
# the L-shaped exit at the bottom (instead of being pinched between the
# servo back-case and the wall and squirting out over the well rim).
# Pilot clearance: the M3 pilots at (x = +/-24.75, y = +/-5) have ~1.25 mm
# radius columns, so their inner Y edges sit at y = +/-3.75.  The channel
# only spans y = +/-WIRE_SLOT_W/2 (= +/-3.5 with WIRE_SLOT_W = 7), so it
# stays clear of the pilots in Y even when deepened further in X.
#
# Depth math with WIRE_CHANNEL_DEPTH = 6.5 (Design E, May 2026):
#   cavity face at +SERVO_BODY_W/2 + WELL_BODY_CL = +20.7;
#   channel outer x = +20.7 + 6.5 = +27.2;
#   boot outboard face at +SERVO_BODY_W/2 + WIRE_BOOT_PROTRUSION =
#     +26.5, so the channel clears the boot's outer face by 0.7 mm --
#     the channel is now genuinely wide enough for the boot to slide
#     all the way down to seated during insertion, instead of forcing
#     the boot to compress 0.8 mm against the +X wall (the pre-Design-E
#     5.0 mm depth left a 0.8 mm interference at the boot's outer edge
#     for all insertion offsets above 9.4 mm; ``check_servo_insertion_
#     path`` flags this regression);
#   pilot at x = +SERVO_TAB_HOLE_PCD/2 = +24.75, pilot radius 1.25 mm so
#     pilot outboard X edge sits at +26.0;
#   channel (y in +/-3.5) and pilots (at y = +/-5, pilot y_min 3.75)
#     are fully separated in Y -- the two never touch in 3D regardless
#     of the channel's X depth, so deepening the channel does not eat
#     pilot material.
#   Wall thickness over the pilot threads (face-to-pilot distance):
#     +WELL_W/2 = +29 to pilot at +24.75 = 4.25 mm -- still >= 4 mm.
#   Remaining +X wall material outboard of the channel (face-to-channel):
#     +WELL_W/2 - channel_outer_x = +29 - 27.2 = 1.8 mm, just above the
#     three-perimeter MIN_PRINT_T = 1.6 mm floor.
WIRE_CHANNEL_DEPTH    = 6.5   # mm groove depth INTO the +X wall material
WIRE_CHANNEL_TOP_OVER_RIM = 2.5  # mm extension of the channel ABOVE the well
                                  # rim, so wires exiting near the top of the
                                  # back-case (micro servos) still find it.

# ---- Cable zip-tie post (printed-in strain relief) ----------------------
# Every servo cradle (yaw / hip-pitch / knee) gets a small printed post on
# the well's +X OUTER wall, just past where the wire-exit slot opens to
# free air.  At assembly time the user loops a 2-3 mm wide zip-tie around
# the post AND the 3-wire bundle, so any tug on the harness pulls the
# bundle against the post (a printed-in strain relief) instead of yanking
# the JST plug at the PCA9685 header.  Without these posts a single
# accidental snag on a leg cable can pop a servo plug off the PCA at the
# worst possible moment (mid-walk gait); with them the harness fails
# safely (the zip-tie bears the load).
#
# Geometry summary (all three cradles use the SAME ``_cable_zip_post()``
# helper applied in well-local frame and then transformed alongside the
# wire_slot, so the post stays anchored to the well wall regardless of
# how each cradle is rotated into its link's frame):
#
#   * Anchored at the well's OUTER +X face (well_x = WELL_W/2 = +29).
#     Inboard face of the post sits AT the wall (= +29); outboard face
#     at +29 + CABLE_POST_X = +31.
#   * Offset in well-Y by CABLE_POST_Y_OFFSET = +7 mm so the post lives
#     OUTSIDE the wire-exit slot's Y span (slot Y in
#     [-WIRE_SLOT_W/2, +WIRE_SLOT_W/2] = [-3.5, +3.5]).  Without the
#     offset the post would sit IN the slot exit and physically block
#     the harness from leaving the cradle.  +7 mm Y centre leaves
#     +7 - CABLE_POST_Y/2 = +4 mm of well-Y clearance from the slot
#     edge at +3.5.
#   * Z centre at CABLE_POST_Z_CENTRE = +6 mm in well-local Z (i.e.,
#     +6 mm above the cavity floor).  Range +2..+10 mm sits comfortably
#     INSIDE the well's outer +X wall material (the wall is solid from
#     well-z = -WELL_FLOOR_T = -3 up to well-z = WELL_RIM_Z = +27.25 at
#     this Y offset since the channel cut only spans y in [-3.5, +3.5]).
#   * 2 x 6 x 8 mm extents (X / Y / Z) -- small enough to print
#     supports-free as a horizontal nub off the vertical well wall in
#     every cradle's print orientation (coxa_bracket prints cradle-up,
#     coxa_link prints with hip cradle opening +Z after the +90 deg X
#     rotation, femur_link prints spar-broad-face-on-bed; in all three
#     the post is a 2 mm-deep ledge along a vertical wall, with the
#     2 mm bottom face printing as a tiny horizontal bridge that FDM
#     handles natively).
#
# Keep-out audit (verified by check_workspace_self_collision +

#     COXA_LIFT lift the post sits at link (x ~ +45, y ~ -42, z ~ +5)
#     -- > 21 mm from the hip pad sweep cylinder centre at

# ---- Per-leg chassis_bottom drop slot (Part B, May 2026) ----------------
# A small 12 x 6 mm slot cut THROUGH the chassis_bottom plate at each of
# the 6 leg positions, located just INBOARD of each coxa_bracket's body
# cutout (which the plate already carries for the servo body's drop-in
# path; see ``_hex_plate``'s body_cutout block).  The slot lets each
# leg's 3-cable harness drop from the bracket-flange-top side of the
# plate INTO the inter-plate volume between chassis_bottom and
# chassis_top -- where the electronics_tray + PCA9685 boards live --
# without the harness having to share the body cutout with the seated
# yaw servo (the body fills ~ 40 x 20 of the cutout's 60 x 31 footprint,
# leaving only ~ 5 mm of margin around the body; cramming 3 wires into
# the margin works but adds risk of pinching the harness against the
# body during assembly).
#
# Slot orientation: LONG axis is along the chassis-radial (bracket +X)
# direction; SHORT axis is tangential (bracket Y).  In each leg's
# bracket frame the PRIMARY slot is centred at:
#     bracket-x = LEG_HARNESS_DROP_X_CENTRE = -46
#                 (inboard of the body-cutout's -X edge)
#     bracket-y = 0  (on the chassis radial line)
# The same hex-leg iterator that ``_hex_plate`` uses to place the body
# cutouts places these slots, so the drop slots always line up with their
# parent cutouts (a regression here is caught by ``check_leg_harness_drop``
# in ``_verify_prototype.py``, which probes EVERY slot in
# ``leg_harness_drop_slots()``).
#
# Jun 2026 wire-room pass: the harness on a real STS3215 leg is a daisy-chain
# of three 3-pin bus cables (servo connectors ~ 8 x 4 mm each), and the
# original 12 x 6 mm port was a tight single drop.  It grew to a 3-port
# perforated band (18 x 8 primary + two 18 x 6 flanks with ~3 mm ribs).
# Aug 2026: the ribs made pushing the Molex connectors through annoying
# (user), so the band is now ONE open 18 x 28 mm port -- the same overall
# envelope as the old 3-port band, just without the ribs -- and the port
# moved 1.5 mm INBOARD (centre -46 -> -47.5, radial span 43.5..61.5): at
# the old centre the ~2.4 mm ligament between the port's outboard edge
# and the body cutout ran the full 28 mm width and tripped the flimsy-
# joints check (was fine when the 3 ribs broke it up); the shift gives a
# ~3.9 mm outboard rib.  Clear of the yaw retainer pilots (tangential
# +/-21; port edge +/-14) -- but NOT of the standoff holes: the original
# claim of ">17 mm tangential" was wrong (a standoff site sits 15 deg
# off the leg axis -> 44*sin(15) = 11.4 mm < the 14 mm half-width), so
# the inboard shift clipped each standoff seat's corner.  Fixed Aug 16
# 2026 with the CHASSIS_STANDOFF_SEAT_PAD_OD pads (see that block);
# each pad bites a ~3.5 x 7 mm corner off the port, which
# check_leg_harness_drop exempts.

# ---- Chassis_bottom cable anchor tab (Part A continued) -----------------
# RETIRED (May 2026): the per-leg vertical anchor tab that used to hang
# DOWN from chassis_bottom's BOTTOM face was removed so the plate's
# bottom face is fully flat (chassis-z = -CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2 = -2 mm
# everywhere) for easier FDM printing.  The 3-cable harness is now
# anchored by looping a zip-tie THROUGH the per-leg drop slot itself --
# no sub-plate geometry required.  The CABLE_ANCHOR_TAB_* constants
# below are PRESERVED so external references (docs, verifier comments,
# historical commits) keep resolving; they are no longer consumed by
# ``make_chassis_bottom``.
#
# Historical placement rationale (kept verbatim for reference):
# Each leg also gets a SMALL printed tab hanging DOWN from chassis_bottom's
# BOTTOM face, immediately adjacent to its ``leg_harness_drop_*`` slot, so
# the assembler can loop a 2-3 mm zip-tie around the tab AND the 3-cable
# harness BELOW the chassis plate -- exactly where the cradle wire-exit
# bundle makes its U-turn from the cradle's lateral wire-exit (at well +X)
# back inboard to the drop slot.  Anchoring the bundle here rather than
# on chassis_bottom's TOP face dodges the electronics_tray (chassis-z in
# [+5, +8] over chassis-x in [-80, +80] x y in [-70, +65], which fully
# blankets the inter-plate volume directly above each drop slot), and it
# matches the harness's natural routing: the cradle wire-exit fires at
# bracket-z ~ -21 (= chassis-z ~ -19, well below the plate), the wire
# hugs the underside of the plate inboard to bracket-x ~ -46, then comes
# UP through the drop slot.  The tab grabs the bundle just BEFORE the
# slot, so any cable tug puts load on the tab + plate instead of the
# servo's JST plug or the cradle wire-exit boot.
#
# Geometry:
#   * Anchored at chassis_bottom's BOTTOM face (chassis-z =
#     -CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2 = -2 mm); extends DOWN by CABLE_ANCHOR_TAB_H so
#     the bottom face sits at chassis-z = -CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2 -
#     CABLE_ANCHOR_TAB_H = -12 mm.  In bracket-local frame the same range
#     is bracket-z in [-12, -2].
#   * Placed at bracket-x = LEG_HARNESS_DROP_X_CENTRE (= -46 mm), so the
#     tab's radial position is centred on the drop slot itself.
#   * Offset to the +Y side of the drop slot by CABLE_ANCHOR_TAB_Y_OFFSET
#     = +5 mm (slot Y in [-3, +3]; tab centre at +5 leaves a 1 mm gap
#     between the slot's +Y edge at +3 and the tab's -Y face at
#     +5 - CABLE_ANCHOR_TAB_W/2 = +1).  The harness exits the slot in
#     the slot's Y span, so the tab's -Y face is the natural surface
#     for the zip-tie to bear against.
#
# Keep-out audit (verified by check_workspace_self_collision +
# check_cable_clearance):
#   * Bracket-x = -46 is 7 mm INBOARD of the yaw well's inboard wall
#     (well outer face at bracket-x = body_centre_x - WELL_W/2 = -39).
#     Below the plate the well + seated yaw servo body occupy
#     bracket-x in [-39, +19]; tab at bracket-x = -46 sits in OPEN
#     air well clear of that volume.
#   * Bracket-x = -46 is 16 mm INBOARD of the bracket flange's inboard
#     edge at bracket-x = -30; the flange is ABOVE the plate (bracket-z
#     in [+2, +17]) so there's no overlap in either X or Z.
#   * Bracket-y = +5 sits outside the drop slot's Y span [-3, +3] and
#     well inside the chassis_bottom plate footprint.  Below the plate
#     in the inter-plate region just inboard of the bracket nothing
#     else exists -- the chassis_bottom plate's underside between the
#     legs is otherwise empty.
#   * The dynamic leg workspace (coxa_link, femur_link, tibia_link)
#     sweeps OUTBOARD from the yaw axis; the inboard region around
#     bracket(-46, *) is not reachable by any leg part.
#     check_workspace_self_collision catches any regression.

# ---- Servo well (open-topped bucket holding ONE servo) -------------------
# The well is the structural pocket that the servo drops into during
# assembly:
#
#     1.  The servo body slides DOWN through the well's wide-open top.
#     2.  Its mounting tabs land on the well's rim at z = WELL_RIM_Z.
#     3.  The user drives 4 standard M3 self-tapping screws DOWN through
#         the tab clearance holes into 4 pilot holes drilled vertically
#         through the well's side walls (positioned at x=+/-SERVO_TAB_
#         HOLE_PCD/2, y=+/-SERVO_TAB_HOLE_PCD_Y/2).
#     4.  Above the rim the body extends another (BODY_H - TAB_Z) mm into
#         open air; the gear stack and horn adapter sit on top of that.
#
# The +X / -X walls (where the M3 pilots live) MUST be thick enough to
# hold the pilot hole AT a comfortable distance inside the wall material.
# With WELL_WALL_X = 9 mm: pilot at x = +/-24.75, wall outer at x =
# +/-29, so 4.25 mm of material sits between the pilot and the outer
# face -- plenty for FDM in PLA / MJF in PA12.

# A small printed strap (``make_yaw_servo_retainer``) bridges the open

# to the flat plate's underside, where they bolt into two blind M3 self-tap
# pilots cut in REAL plate material on the TANGENTIAL flanks of the body cutout.
# The cross-bar physically blocks the hanging yaw servo from dropping (the
# servo is captured between the HIGH-half mount plate on top and this bar
# below).  All coords below are cradle-local: +X = radial outboard (the
# yaw-axis -> hex-edge-midpoint direction), +Y = tangential, origin = yaw axis.

# +/-Y side walls (walls span cradle-x [-35.4, +10.2]) and clear of the harness

# faces -- the dangling body could rock tangentially in that slop (user report:
# "the retainer is loose, the servo wobbles").  Each arm now carries an inward
# GRIP JAW that closes that gap to a snug-but-assemblable slip fit: the jaw
# inner face lands RETAINER_BODY_GRIP_CL off the SERVO_BODY_D/2 face, so the
# body still slides straight DOWN the Z channel into / out of the jaws (no
# interference, no insertion block) but cannot rock sideways once seated.
# 0.15 mm/side is tight enough to kill the wobble yet > one FDM line-width of
# play so the body seats by hand; this is INTENTIONALLY far tighter than the
# shared WELL_BODY_CL (0.7) cavity clearance, which is left untouched so the

# flat BASE plate on 4 corner posts, opening a cable run-out cavity between the
# base and the bar (OPEN on all four sides between the posts) where the bundle
# turns and exits laterally instead of being crushed.  The base carries the

# _chk diagnostic): the old stirrup threaded its 2 anchor bolts UP through a
# ~20 mm arm into the floor with a SOLID stand-off base SEALING the bolt axis
# from below -> undrivable (a ~38 mm screw down 34 mm of part), and held the
# case with 1 mm of axial slop + only two 0.15 mm-clearance side jaws (no
# radial / rotational key).  The yaw CASE cannot actually fall -- it hangs from
# the output shaft via the servo's internal bearings -> disc horn -> coxa_link
# -> 6805 yaw tower -> chassis -- so the real need is ANTI-ROTATION (reaction
# torque) + anti-wobble + a DRIVABLE chassis anchor.  (The rear idler boss
# rotates WITH the output, so a passive horn there would LOCK yaw -- hence we
# key the CASE, not the boss.)
SADDLE_BODY_CL      = 0.12  # mm -- snug wall clearance per case face (anti-rotation)
SADDLE_WALL_T       = 3.0   # mm -- saddle wall thickness

                            #       Jun 2026: kept THICK (user: "I liked the thicker
                            #       walls for the screw holes") -- the head does NOT bear
                            #       on the bottom face; instead a COUNTERBORE recesses it
                            #       (SADDLE_HEAD_CB_*), so the head seat is at z=-9 and the
                            #       M3x6 tip still lands at the -3 pilot bottom (3 mm bite,
                            #       1 mm blind cap preserved).  An M3x8 would need the seat
                            #       at -11 (no recess) or overshoot the 4 mm plate.
# Recessed-head counterbore in each thick screw-hole boss (user: "leave room for
# the screw head to go lower").  A Phi SADDLE_HEAD_CB_OD bore opens DOWNWARD from
# the flange bottom (-11) up SADDLE_HEAD_CB_DEPTH, so the M3 SHCS head recesses
# into the boss and bears on the counterbore shoulder at z = -11 + depth = -9
# (driver still enters straight up the open cavity into the down-facing socket).

# still).  The model's driven-horn top sits SERVO_BODY_H + DISC_HORN_H = 36.3 mm
# above the case back face (SERVO_BODY_H = 34.3 is the STEP mount-HOLE-plane gap,
# NOT the full case length), so the REAL flat bottom hangs ~2.7 mm BELOW the
# modeled back face.  SERVO_BODY_H is the FROZEN kinematic anchor (JOINT_HORN_TOP_Z,
# passive-horn planes, well, clamp caps) so we do NOT move it globally; instead the
# yaw SADDLE references the real bottom via this local drop so its case-hugging
# walls run ~3 mm TALLER and SEAT FLUSH (the old short ref propped the saddle low,
# the backstop hitting the longer real case ~3 mm before the flange reached the
# floor).  Rounded to 3.0 (>= the user's ">=3 mm" ask; +0.3 mm anti-drop gap also
# clears the lower rear boss through the central drop window).

# Jun 2026 wire-exit follow-up (user: "doesnt leave space for the wires that come
# out of the center of the bottom").  The harness exits the CENTER of the case
# back (bottom) face and drops STRAIGHT DOWN, so the backstop floor is opened
# into a perimeter FRAME: a SADDLE_FLOOR_RIM-wide ledge on the -X + -/+Y edges
# (still catches the case back-face rim as an anti-drop backstop AND is the
# print bed face) with a big central DROP WINDOW so the wire falls free into the
# open under-chassis cavity.  (We do NOT screw into the rear boss/horn to "cover"
# it: that boss rotates 1:1 with the yaw output, so a chassis-fixed screw into it
# would LOCK the yaw DOF -- the case-keyed walls give the anti-rotation instead.)
SADDLE_FLOOR_RIM    = 5.0   # mm -- backstop-frame ledge width on the -X / +-Y edges

# ---- Aug 2026 retainer ground FEET (v4, four corner poles) --------------------
# History: 38 mm open-cage "permanent ground stand" (replaced the belly
# stilts) -> deleted in the flat-belly rework -> v2 C-shell foot (flimsy)
# -> v3 tripod to a central Ø30 disk -> user: the disk sits directly
# under the case-back servo PLUG (the harness plugs into the case bottom
# centre, through the floor drop window) and makes it hard to reach.  v4
# clears the whole underside: FOUR slender corner POLES, each ending in a
# small ground pad, so the plug can be (un)mated from below/side with
# nothing in the way.  Depths below the chassis underside (plate_bot =
# -6): saddle floor bottom ~24.1 mm, case-boss head plane ~24.6 mm.  A
# 34 mm foot leaves ~9 mm of protected air under the wire exits when the
# robot belly-sits.
#
# Pole placement must dodge EIGHT vertical driver corridors (verifier):
#   * Φ12 PHILLIPS under each M2.5 case screw (-8.3/-32.8, +-10.2),
#     from the boss head plane (~-30.6) down 80 mm;
#   * Φ8 HEX_KEY under each M3 flange anchor (-12.5/-29, +-21),
#     from the head recess (-9) down 30 mm (reaches z -39!).
# All four poles run FULL HEIGHT, tops flush with plate_bot (same top Z,
# user Aug 2026 -- all posts bear on the chassis underside).  FRONT poles
# weld flat onto the +-Y side-wall outer faces near the +X end (full wall
# height).  REAR poles sit diagonally off the saddle's rear corners --
# outside the x2 Φ12 corridors -- tied in by a corner GUSSET in the
# backstop-floor z band, whose underside stays ABOVE the M2.5 head plane,
# so it may legally bridge OVER the screw corridor.
#
# Print orientation: v4 flips the part FLANGE-DOWN (see
# print_orientation._reorient_yaw_servo_retainer) -- four small pads can
# no longer be the largest downward plane, so feet-down would trip the
# flat-bottom guard on the floating backstop floor; flange-down the big

# Jun 2026 STEP-driven rear case-mount capture (CORRECTED, 3rd pass; the prior two
# passes wrongly bolted the HORN bolt circle).  Re-parsed STS3215_c.step and

# (X,Z)=(+-7,0),(0,+-7) at the OUTPUT axis, both the +Y front face s17 and the -Y
# rear face s18) are the DISC-HORN bolt circle -- NOT a case mount.  The model's
# own SERVO_BODY_H constant documents the real case mounting holes: it is the gap
# "between the two 4x M2.5 hole planes (STEP)" = the BACK and FRONT(output) case
# faces.  On the FIXED rear (back) case face (STEP solid 1) those 4 holes sit at
# STEP (X,Z) = (8.3, +-10.2) and (32.8, +-10.2), drilled along the output axis.
# Frame: cradle_x = -STEP_X, cradle_y = STEP_Z, cradle_z = STEP_Y (output, UP), so
# they map to cradle (x,y) = (-8.3,+-10.2) [18.5 mm from the +X/output-end "top",
# the user's landmark, just above the centre wire boot] and (-32.8,+-10.2) [43 mm].
# All 4 are on the FIXED case shell, clear of the rotating idler (at the axis,

# and the body had to be pressed ~34 mm into a closed tube to reach the
# plate.  The sandwich fixed side now holds the servo by its BODY:
#   * 3 walls (both +/-X end walls + the -Y long wall) locate the body;
#   * the +Y long face is OPEN so the body drops in LATERALLY;
#   * a separate ``make_servo_clamp_cap`` bolts over the +Y face and clamps
#     the body against the -Y wall (2x M3 into the +/-X wall +Y ends);

# ---- "Drop-in" assembly features ----------------------------------------
# Two changes to the otherwise solid bucket geometry that make seating the
# servo body MUCH easier without compromising structural function:
#   1. Finger-access notches cut through the +Y / -Y walls above a short
#      bottom pocket.  The bottom pocket guides the servo into the cavity;
#      the notches let you reach in from the sides with thumb + forefinger
#      to pinch / wiggle the body the rest of the way down.  The notches
#      do NOT touch the +X / -X walls (where the M3 pilots and tab seats
#      live), so the bracket's structural posts are unchanged.
#   2. A short lead-in chamfer at the top of the cavity that opens the
#      mouth slightly wider than the body so the body can self-align on
#      its way down rather than catching on a sharp inside corner.
WELL_BOTTOM_POCKET_H = 6.0   # mm of full +Y/-Y wall below the notch (guides
                              # the bottom of the servo body into the cavity)
WELL_FINGER_NOTCH_W  = 24.0  # mm wide (along body long axis X) — wide enough
                              # to pinch the body but narrow enough to leave
                              # ~8 mm of wall material at each +X/-X tab post
WELL_LEAD_IN_H       = 1.8   # mm tall rim chamfer
WELL_LEAD_IN_EXTRA   = 0.8   # mm extra clearance per side at the very top of
                              # the cavity, tapering down to WELL_BODY_CL

# ---- Chassis_bottom-integrated yaw-servo cradle (May 2026) --------------
# Replaces the role of the legacy ``make_coxa_bracket()`` part: instead of
# a separate flange+well that bolts to chassis_bottom from above, the yaw
# servo's cradle is now printed AS PART OF chassis_bottom -- a printed
# boss rises ``CRADLE_BOSS_H_MM`` mm above the plate's top face, with a
# tab shelf at ``CRADLE_TAB_SHELF_Z`` where the servo's mounting ears
# land.  The body's bulk hangs DOWN through the plate's existing per-leg
# body cutout (the same ``WELL_W + 2`` x ``WELL_D + 2`` rectangle cut by
# ``_hex_plate`` for the legacy bracket's well drop-in).
#
# Cradle-local frame: origin at the YAW AXIS (= chassis hex edge
# midpoint, where the output spline pokes up); +X = outboard radial;
# +Y = tangential along the chassis edge; +Z = up.  Cradle-z = 0
# coincides with chassis_bottom's TOP face -- pick this anchor instead
# of the plate centre so the boss height value matches the user-facing
# spec ("11 mm above the plate top"; see CRADLE_BOSS_H_MM below for
# the history of the original +19 spec and why it dropped to +11).
#
# Z layout (cradle-local; cradle-z = 0 = chassis_bottom_top):
#     cradle-z = +CRADLE_BOSS_H_MM   = +11  boss top (cradle rim; set
#                                            by the cable-clearance
#                                            floor at chassis-z = +13)

#     cradle-z = -CHASSIS_PLATE_T    =  -4  chassis_bottom_bot (cradle
#                                            ends here; body bulk hangs
#                                            below in free air)
#
# Body Z layout (with tabs landing on the shelf):
#     body bottom at cradle-z = +CRADLE_TAB_SHELF_Z - SERVO_TAB_Z = -21
#     body top    at cradle-z = +CRADLE_TAB_SHELF_Z + (SERVO_BODY_H
#                                                       - SERVO_TAB_Z) = +17
# The body's gear housing top at cradle-z = +17 now pokes 6 mm ABOVE
# the cradle rim (+11) into the inter-plate gap.  chassis_top's
# underside sits at cradle-z = CHASSIS_GAP - 2 = +18 (Aug 2026 gap
# shrink, was +30), i.e. only ~1 mm above the housing -- but the
# housings are at the yaw cradles (r ~ 100), 40+ mm OUTSIDE the Ø115
# top disk's footprint (r 57.5), so there is no vertical stack-up to
# clear.  See the CRADLE_BOSS_H_MM docstring below for the Path-A fix
# that took the rim from +19 down to +11.
#
# Bonding: the cradle's outer footprint is wider than the plate's body
# cutout (``WELL_W + 2`` x ``WELL_D + 2`` = 60 x 31 mm) by
# ``CRADLE_BOND_STRIP_MM`` on each side, so the cradle overhangs the
# cutout edges and bonds to plate material via boolean union when the
# meshes are joined in ``make_chassis_bottom``.  The +X bond strip
# overhangs PAST the chassis edge (cradle-x > 0) into empty air -- no
# plate material there to bond with -- so only the -X / +Y / -Y bond
# strips carry actual bonding load.  Adequate given the cradle's
# modest 11 mm height above the plate.
#
# Wire features: the -X (radially INWARD) wall carries the wire-exit
# slot and the printed zip-tie strain-relief post (mirror-flipped
# copies of ``_wire_exit_slot()`` / ``_cable_zip_post()`` -- both
# helpers are hard-coded to well-+X, so the cradle helper applies an
# x-reflection transform before unioning).  Routing the 3-wire servo
# harness OUT on the cradle's INBOARD face sends it toward the
# chassis centre, where it follows chassis_bottom's top face to the
# per-leg cable-drop slot at chassis-frame
# (LEG_HARNESS_DROP_X_CENTRE, 0) = (-46, 0) in cradle-x / cradle-y,
# then drops into the inter-plate gap.  The legacy bracket's wire
# slot is on the +X (OUTBOARD) face -- its docstring claims inboard
# routing but the actual mesh has always exited outboard.  That
# inconsistency stays unresolved on the bracket since the part
# retires entirely in the final cleanup commit; the new integrated
# cradle gets the inboard exit the project always wanted.
#
# Heat-set inserts: the cradle reuses the same MIXED-MODE Design E
# pattern as every other servo cradle in the project: 2 -X bolts per
# cradle get a Phi CRADLE_BOSS_OD = 8 mm boss + Phi INSERT_M3_PILOT_OD
# = 4 mm heat-set insert pocket (McMaster 94459A130), 2 +X bolts get a
# bare Phi INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_PILOT_OD = 2.5 mm self-tap pilot (no boss,
# because the Phi 8 mm boss footprint cannot coexist with the +X wire
# channel that the servo's molded wire boot has to pass through during
# insertion).  See the ``CRADLE_BOSS_*`` / ``INSERT_M3_*`` /
# ``INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_*`` constant blocks above for the full rationale.

# ---- Bracket yaw-well TRIM plane ----------------------------------------
# May 2026 user-driven simplification:  the bracket's yaw-servo well used
# to extend ``WELL_RIM_Z + WELL_FLOOR_T = 30.25 mm`` below the chassis-
# plate top face -- a 38 mm DS3225 body fully enclosed by ~27 mm of side
# walls plus a 3 mm perimeter floor.  The user pointed out that the
# walls only need to extend deep enough to host the bracket-level
# heat-set insert bosses at bracket-z in [-13, -3] (= 10 mm boss height
# starting 3 mm below the effective shelf top); below that, the wall
# material is just lateral confinement for a servo body that the
# four tabs already hold up structurally.
#
# ``BRACKET_WELL_TRIM_Z`` is the bracket-z plane below which all bracket
# material is removed by the final boolean subtraction in
# ``make_coxa_bracket``.  Set to -15 mm:
#
#   * 2 mm of margin BELOW the bracket-level insert bosses (boss bottom
#     at bracket-z = -13).
#   * 5 mm of margin below the WELL-level inboard-bolt insert bosses
#     emitted by ``_servo_well_solid`` (bracket-z in [-10, 0]).
#   * The DS3225 wire-exit boot, centred at bracket-z ~ -19, hangs
#     EXPOSED below the trim plane.  The +X insertion channel
#     (boot-drop path) above the trim is preserved -- the boot still
#     slides freely from the rim down to its seated position.
#   * The bracket's lowest point moves from bracket-z = -30.25 to
#     bracket-z = -15 (a 15.25 mm reduction in vertical extent).
#
# The trim is applied to the BRACKET ONLY (``make_coxa_bracket``); the
# coxa_link (hip-pitch cradle) and femur_link (knee cradle) keep their
# existing full-depth walls because their wells participate in those
# links' structural geometry differently.
BRACKET_WELL_TRIM_Z = -15.0

# ---- Servo horn adapter (DEPRECATED -- retained for backward compat) -----
# Design B (May 2026): the printed servo_horn_adapter has been RETIRED.
# Each driven link (coxa_link, femur_link, tibia_link) now bolts DIRECTLY
# onto a 20 mm aluminum 25T DISC horn (Amazon B07D56FVK5): 4 x M3
# clearance holes are carved straight into the link's mating pad on the
# DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD = 14 mm pattern, and a DISC_HORN_COLLAR_OD x
# DISC_HORN_COLLAR_DEPTH bore clears the disc's central spline collar.
#
# Retired-scheme history (kept for context): an intermediate Design B
# bolted the link onto the plastic 4-arm X-horn that ships with the
# servo.  Those X-horn bolts were originally drawn as M3 SHCS
# (Phi 3.2 mm clearance), which was WRONG -- the X-horn that shipped
# with DS3225 / MG996R / DS3218-class servos had Phi ~ 2.0 mm untapped
# through-holes in its arms (M2 self-tap-sized), not Phi 3.2 mm
# clearance, so that pad bored Phi 2.2 mm and used M2 x 8 SHCS as a
# self-tapper into the X-horn plastic.  That whole plastic-X-horn
# scheme is RETIRED in favour of the aluminum disc horn (4 x M3 x 6
# SHCS into the disc's M3 TAPPED holes).  The cradle bolts (4 per servo
# into a Phi 2.5 mm printed shelf pilot) were always orthogonal to this
# and stay M3 x 8 (b447f88).  The adapter geometry below is left in
# place so old STL references / spare-stock screenshots
# keep resolving, but ``make_servo_horn_adapter`` is no longer called
# from any printable output path and no ``servo_horn_adapter.stl`` is
# written by ``main()``.
HORN_ADAPTER_OD     = 32.0   # mm -- plate OD; gives (32 - 20.8) / 2 - 1.1
                              # = 4.5 mm wall outboard of each M2 bolt
                              # hole on the retired adapter's 20.8 mm PCD
HORN_ADAPTER_T      =  4.0   # mm -- thickness (LEGACY).  No longer added
                              # to any joint output Z stack.
# Servo horn stack height.  Historically the hobby-servo plastic horn;
# the robot now drives a 20 mm aluminum 25T disc horn of the same ~5 mm
# thickness that screws onto the 25T spline with an M3 centre screw.
# Adds 5 mm of "stack" along the output-shaft direction between the
# servo's gear-stack top face and the link's pad MATING face.  With the
# printed adapter retired, this IS the entire horn stack (it used to be
# PLASTIC_HORN_H + HORN_ADAPTER_T = 9 mm).
PLASTIC_HORN_H      =  5.0
# Now-retired plastic 4-arm X-shaped horn (DS3225 / MG996R / DS3218 -class
# hardware): the arms extended ~18 mm from the spline centre, so that horn
# swept a Phi 36 mm cylinder as the servo rotated.  The current 20 mm
# aluminum disc horn sweeps only Phi 20 mm, but this larger X-horn sweep
# is retained as a CONSERVATIVE clearance envelope.  It is bigger than
# the retired X-horn's 20.8 mm bolt circle (radius 10.4 mm): each arm ran
# past the bolt position to give the user a thumb-purchase for hand-
# tightening + spare hole positions.  Drives:
#   * ``make_servo_horn`` arm length (the visual mesh's bounding
#     cylinder reflects the real-hardware sweep, so any verifier that
#     reads the mesh extents picks up the correct horn radius).
#   * ``check_horn_sweep_clearance`` in _verify_prototype.py (the
#     cylinder void that the bracket's flange / walls must respect
#     above the seated servo, so the horn can rotate freely without
#     clashing with printed material).
# History: an earlier draft used a 20 mm-long arm (tip at radius
# 10 mm = INSIDE the bolt circle) which silently understated the
# sweep radius by ~9 mm.  The horn-sweep clearance test would have
# missed the recurring "the servo motor doesn't stick out high
# enough" failure if it had read that mesh's bounding cylinder.
#
# User-measured May 2026: 36 mm horn diameter on the actual hardware
# (user has the physical plastic X-horns in hand and measured them
# with calipers).  Was 19.0 mm tip radius / Phi 38 mm sweep; now
# 18.0 mm / Phi 36 mm.
PLASTIC_HORN_X_TIP_R = 18.0
# Total height of the servo output stack ABOVE the spline tip.  In the
# hip-pitch and knee-pitch joints this is the offset between the joint
# AXIS (where the spline pokes out of the servo body) and the link's
# pad MATING face (where the link bolts directly onto the disc horn).
# Driven links must offset their pad along the joint axis by this much,
# then bridge the gap back to the spar with a short "neck" -- without
# this offset the link's pad sits directly on the joint axis and
# overlaps the cradle's "swept volume" (the bridge cap / well wall
# material right above the body).
#
# May 2026: HORN_STACK_H collapses to PLASTIC_HORN_H = 5 mm (was
# PLASTIC_HORN_H + HORN_ADAPTER_T = 9 mm) now that the printed
# horn-adapter disc has been removed.  The link's pad bolts directly
# to the disc horn's top face.
HORN_STACK_H        = PLASTIC_HORN_H



# ---- Yaw-axis output Z (chassis frame, May 2026 chassis_bottom cradle) ---
# World-z (pre-lift) of the yaw disc horn's TOP mating face, where the
# coxa_link's pedestal-bottom mating plane sits.  This is THE most-
# duplicated coordinate in the codebase -- the same formula recurs in
# ``build_prototype_assembly``, ``fastener_registry`` (yaw / hip /
# knee cradle transforms), ``_verify_prototype`` (5 separate places),
# ``inspect_build``, ``render_leg_assembly``, and ``arm/integrate``.
# Centralising it here keeps the May 2026 chassis-bottom-integrated
# yaw-cradle redesign (which lifted yaw_output_z by +8 mm from the
# legacy bracket layout) confined to a single constant edit.
#
# Z stack (chassis-z = 0 = chassis_bottom CENTRE; world-z post-lift
# is chassis-z + chassis_lift):
#
#   chassis_bottom top         z = CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2          = +2
#   cradle tab shelf           z = CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2
#                                    + CRADLE_TAB_SHELF_Z      = +8
#   servo body bottom          z = shelf - WELL_RIM_Z          = -19.25
#                                  (= +8 - +27.25)
#   servo body top             z = body_bottom + SERVO_BODY_H  = +18.75
#   output-gear top            z = body_top + SERVO_OUTPUT_H   = +24.75
#   disc-horn top (yaw_output) z = gear_top + HORN_STACK_H     = +29.75
#
# Legacy formula (bracket-based, pre-May-2026):
#   yaw_output_z_legacy = (SERVO_BODY_H - WELL_RIM_Z)
#                          + SERVO_OUTPUT_H + HORN_STACK_H = +21.75
# New formula simply adds the cradle-shelf offset
# (CHASSIS_PLATE_T/2 + CRADLE_TAB_SHELF_Z = +8) on top of the legacy
# stack: the servo's mounting tabs no longer rest at chassis-z = 0
# (= chassis_bottom CENTRE, the legacy bracket-flange reference
# plane) but on the new cradle shelf at chassis-z = +8 (= +6 mm above
# chassis_bottom TOP).
# STS3215 refit (Jun 2026): the legacy tab-shelf formula above collapses
# under the front-face mount -- with WELL_RIM_Z == SERVO_BODY_H the
# ``(SERVO_BODY_H - WELL_RIM_Z)`` term goes to 0 and the result silently
# drops to 15.0 mm, sinking the whole leg-mount height and folding the
# coxa into the chassis plates.  Since this coordinate sets where every
# leg bolts onto the chassis, it is PINNED to the proven DS3225 value
# (29.75 mm) so the kinematic chain / RL policy / MuJoCo model and the
# horn-to-chassis_top clearance are all preserved.  The front-face yaw
# cradle (``_chassis_yaw_cradle_solid``) is built to deliver the disc-
# horn top mating face exactly at this height, so the constant and the
# cradle geometry stay consistent.
#
# SPACED-PAIR refit (Jun 2026): to fit the second yaw bearing above the
# disc horn we LOWER this output plane by YAW_TOWER_RAISE and LIFT the hip
# the same amount (COXA_HIP_DROP += YAW_TOWER_RAISE), so the WORLD hip-pitch
# axis Z (29.75 + 17.1 = 46.85) is unchanged and the kinematic chain / RL /
# MuJoCo model stay fixed.  Both the cradle geometry and the coxa hub are
# built from this constant so they track the change automatically.
CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z = 29.75 - YAW_TOWER_RAISE   # 20.75
# Retired link-to-horn bolt-circle history (superseded by the disc-horn
# block below -- see DISC_HORN_BOLT_* for the live values).  The
# now-retired plastic 4-arm X-horn put its 4 bolt holes on a ~20.8 mm
# PCD (the SECOND hole position out from the spline on each arm of a
# standard DS3225 / MG996R / DS3218 plastic horn) at 0 / 90 / 180 / 270
# deg.  The CURRENT disc horn keeps the same 0 / 90 / 180 / 270 cross
# angles (DISC_HORN_BOLT_ANGLES_RAD) but on a 14 mm bolt circle.
#
# Old May 2026 fastener-spec note (the retired X-horn scheme, kept for
# history):
#     The plastic X-horn that shipped with DS3225 / MG996R / DS3218-class
#     hobby servos had Phi ~ 2.0 mm UNTAPPED through-holes in its arms
#     (intended for M2 self-tap), NOT Phi 3.2 mm clearance for M3, so the
#     old link pad bored Phi 2.2 mm and bolted on with 4 x M2 SHCS used
#     as self-tappers into the X-horn's plastic arm.  That whole scheme
#     is RETIRED: the link now bolts with 4 x M3 x 6 SHCS straight into
#     the aluminium disc's M3 TAPPED holes (DISC_HORN_BOLT_OD = 3.4 mm
#     clearance).  The cradle bolts were always orthogonal to this and
#     stay M3 x 8 (they self-tap into a Phi 2.5 mm printed shelf pilot).
#     See fastener_registry.py and fasteners/README.md for the SKUs.
# ---- Disc-horn bolt circle (June 2026: 20 mm aluminum 25T disc) ----------
# The servo joints now drive a 20 mm aluminum 25T DISC horn (MG995 /
# MG996R type, Amazon B07D56FVK5), NOT the plastic 4-arm X-horn.  The
# disc presents 4 x M3 TAPPED mounting holes on a cross pattern at
# 0 / 90 / 180 / 270 deg.  The vendor lists "14 mm hole spacing"; we
# interpret that as a 14 mm BOLT-CIRCLE DIAMETER (radius 7), which is
# the only reading that physically fits a 20 mm disc -- holes at r=7
# leave 3 mm to the disc edge.
#
# ALTERNATIVE interpretation (reject unless the user's calipers say
# so): "14 mm" = the side of a 14 mm SQUARE, putting the 4 holes at
# (+/-7, +/-7) = radius 9.9 mm -- basically off the 20 mm disc edge.
# To switch to the square reading it is a ONE-LINE change: set
# DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD = 14.0 * 2**0.5 (= 19.8 mm diagonal) and change
# DISC_HORN_BOLT_ANGLES_RAD to (pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, 7pi/4).
#
# DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD is THE single source of truth for the link-to-horn
# bolt circle (referenced in ~30 places).  Changing the one value here
# moves every link pad, every fastener, the disc visual and the spec
# together.
DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD    = 14.0   # mm -- disc-horn 4 x M3 bolt-circle DIAMETER
DISC_HORN_BOLT_ANGLES_RAD = (0.0, np.pi / 2.0, np.pi, 3.0 * np.pi / 2.0)

# goBILDA 1906 25T aluminum servo hub
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An aluminum (anodized) low-profile servo hub from goBILDA.  Same H25T
# spline as the now-retired DS3225 / MG996R / DS3218 plastic X-horn we
# still model with ``make_servo_horn`` -- so it can SHARE the servo, but
# the bolt pattern is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD.  The
# 1906 hub presents 4 x M4 threaded holes on a 16 mm SQUARE pattern on
# its TOP face: bolts at (+/-8, +/-8) mm from the spline centre.  Compare
# the retired X-horn's 20.8 mm PCD at 0 / 90 / 180 / 270 degrees -- the
# two are not interchangeable.
#
# Why we're modeling it (user report, May 2026):
#     The OEM plastic 4-arm X-horn that ships with hobby servos
#     ("make_servo_horn") strips its spline after a few load cycles at
#     the hexapod's femur joint.  Replacing it with the goBILDA 1906
#     aluminum hub (4.7 g, $4.99) is the upgrade path.  Using this hub
#     requires REDESIGNING the link's mounting pad (DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD ->
#     16 mm square M4 grid) which is a separate decision; for now we
#     only PROVIDE the parametric factory + STL so a user can preview
#     the swap visually.

# Femur hip-pad mating-face recess.  The coxa_link's pedestal-bottom
# horn_hub_recess at DISC_HORN_COLLAR_DEPTH = 2.0 mm is sized for the
# nominal "spline-collar / screw-head protrusion + FDM tolerance"
# case (see the disc-horn block above).  User-flagged May 2026: on the
# femur_link side the disc horn can sit a few mm LOWER than nominal due
# to spline-cap manufacturing variation, gear backlash, and how
# tightly the central M3 screw is torqued down on the spline.  If
# the disc horn slides ~3 mm down its spline relative to the servo
# output disc, the disc horn's central screw head also sits ~3 mm
# closer to the pad's mating face -- so the femur_link needs a
# deeper recess than the coxa_link to keep the pad seating flush
# against the disc-horn top plane.
#
# Depth 4.0 mm = 1.0 mm nominal protrusion + 3.0 mm extra slack for
# the horn's vertical position uncertainty.  (The bolt-interference
# sizing below is from the now-RETIRED Phi 16 mm plastic-X-horn hub

# circle.)  Material budget at the pad's central annulus (radius r in

# = 2 mm of pad cap left between this recess and the +Y outer face --

# M3 TAPPED hole.  The aluminium disc IS the thread-engagement medium
# (no heat-set insert, no self-tap into plastic).  The link's pad just
# needs a clean Phi 3.4 mm clearance through-hole for the M3 shank.
# Bottom-cap geometry on driven link pads.  Each printed link pad has
# to:

#       bolts seat (PCD = DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD = 14 mm, radius 7, well
#       within every pad footprint),
#   (b) recess each M3 SHCS head into a counter-bore so the head
#       doesn't protrude into the assembly trough above and block
#       the hip-pitch / knee servo body's insertion path.

# With HORN_STACK_VOID_R = PLASTIC_HORN_X_TIP_R + 0.5 = 18.5 mm and a
# 1.5 mm wall the minimum is 18.5 + 1.5 = 20.0 mm.  A SHRUNK pad
# (HIP_PAD_R = 17, the very old value) leaves only 0.5 mm of wall,
# which cannot be FDM-printed reliably at 0.4 mm nozzle.
#
# May 2026 (post-flange-ring-fuse refactor): HIP_PAD_R bumped from
# 19.5 to 20.0 mm.  The previous 19.5 mm value left a 1.0 mm-thick
# neck wall (HIP_PAD_R - HORN_STACK_VOID_R = 1.0 mm), which prints
# as a single perimeter at 0.4 mm nozzle and is fragile.  More
# importantly, the May 2026 "shorten-neck" refactor (7e2ca87)
# collapsed the neck to a 2 mm flange ring at y in [+3, +5] with
# only a 0.5 mm "boolean kiss" volumetric fuse with the spar at
# y in [+2.5, +3].  The user complained twice that the tibia
# spar <-> knee pad joint looked like it would break in service
# (TIBIA_SPAR_H = 18 mm has only ~half the femur's pad-side fuse
# cross-section to work with), and a Y-sweep probe of the cross-
# section confirmed the fuse area dropped from a tall column to
# a 0.5 mm sliver.  The fix is Option A from the May 2026
# pad <-> spar fuse audit: bump HIP_PAD_R to 20.0 (wall thickness
# 1.5 mm, 3 perimeters @ 0.4 mm nozzle) AND deepen the neck back
# to ~8 mm (y in [-LINK_THICKNESS/2, HORN_STACK_H] = [-3, +5]) so
# the full volumetric fusion with the spar at y in [-3, +3] is
# restored.  Cup ID stays at PLASTIC_HORN_X_TIP_R + 0.5 = 18.5 mm,
# the conservative envelope of the now-retired Phi 36 mm plastic
# X-horn; the current 20 mm disc horn clears it easily.
#
# Bumping HIP_PAD_R increases the pad's swept disk diameter (39 mm
# -> 40 mm) which means the pad reaches 0.5 mm further toward the
# coxa_link arm's bottom face and the bracket flange.  COXA_LIFT
# (36 mm) and WELL_Z_DROP_EXTRA (4 mm) were sized with ~2 mm of
# headroom above the swept disk's +Z edge at HIP_PAD_R = 19.5, so
# the 0.5 mm bump shrinks the headroom to 1.5 mm -- still well
# above the WORKSPACE_VOXEL_PITCH = 2.5 mm artefact band.  See

# still covering the 4 retired-X-horn PCD bolts at radius 10.4 mm with
# safe margin (wall thickness = 14 - 10.4 - M2_HEAD_OD_CLEARANCE/2 =
# 14 - 10.4 - 2.0 = 1.6 mm of pad material outboard of each head
# counter-bore; well above the 1.5 mm = 3 perimeter @ 0.4 mm nozzle
# minimum).  The current 14 mm disc-horn M3 bolt circle (radius 7) sits
# even further inside this pad, so the coverage margin only improves.
#
# Why the constraint HIP_PAD_R >= HORN_STACK_VOID_R + 1.5 mm wall
# (= 20 mm, see the HIP_PAD_R docstring above) does NOT apply here:
# that constraint was for the pre-May-2026 HOLLOW ANNULUS NECK
# design where the pad enclosed the X-horn inside a printed cup
# (the cup wall had to be >= 1.5 mm thick at FDM tolerance).  The
# post-2026 COLLINEAR-PAD refactor moved the pad from y in
# [-HORN_STACK_H, +LINK_THICKNESS+5] to a flat solid disc at NEW y
# in [0, +LINK_THICKNESS], sitting ABOVE the X-horn (X-horn at y in
# [-HORN_STACK_H, 0]).  The pad no longer encloses the horn, so the
# wall-thickness constraint vanishes.  See make_femur_link's
# "NEW (May 2026 collinear-pad refactor)" comment block.
#
# The pad's swept clearance cut in make_coxa_link (pad_sweep_clear =
# HIP_PAD_R + 0.5) is left at HIP_PAD_R = 20 mm + 0.5 mm = 20.5 mm
# even though the femur's actual sweep is now only 14 mm radius;
# the cut just removes more coxa_link pedestal material than strictly
# needed (no structural concern -- only fewer mm^3 of plastic) and
# stays consistent with the historical sizing.  The tibia's knee pad
# clearance cut (knee_clear_R = HIP_PAD_R + 2.5) is sized for the
# TIBIA's pad (still HIP_PAD_R = 20 mm) so it stays unchanged.
FEMUR_HIP_PAD_R  = 14.0

# ---- Coxa-link bridge stiffener -----------------------------------------
# The coxa link's "bridge" -- the flat 4 mm-thick arm + 6.5 mm-tall
# bridge member that connects the horn-mating yoke (the inboard 4-bolt
# hub pad that clamps onto the yaw servo's horn adapter) to the
# hip-pitch servo cradle at the outboard end -- carries up to ~2.5 N*m
# of hip-pitch reaction torque about the link's local +Y axis.  In that
# bending direction the arm is the THIN dimension: only 4 mm of Z height
# at the +X end of the bridge (just inboard of the cradle's outer +X
# wall), giving I_y = 22*4^3/12 = 117 mm^4, sigma_max = 2.5 N*m * 2 mm /
# 117 mm^4 = 43 MPa -- a 1.2x safety factor against PA12's 50 MPa yield
# and visibly flexible under hand fit-check load.  For comparison the
# femur's tall 30 mm spar runs sigma_max ~ 3 MPa in the same bending
# direction (SF ~ 18x).
#
# Adding a thin gusset hanging BELOW the arm in the bridge region
# extends the cross-section's Z range to ~8 mm, raising I_y to
# ~570 mm^4 and dropping sigma_max to ~20 MPa (SF ~ 2.5x).  Geometric
# clearance constraints:
#   - Inboard X start >= HIP_PAD_R + 1 mm so the gusset doesn't clip
#     the horn adapter's 32 mm OD circular footprint underneath the hub.
#   - Z depth <= servo-body-top clearance so the gusset's bottom face
#     stays above the hip-pitch servo body's top face during insertion
#     (with arm_t = 6 mm and the well dropped by -(WELL_D/2 + arm_t/2)
#     = -15.5 mm, the seated body top sits at link-z = -5.5 mm; a 5 mm
#     gusset puts the bottom face at -5.0, leaving 0.5 mm of clearance).
#   - Outboard X end stays inside the arm's +X tail (link-x <= 41) so
#     the gusset doesn't overhang past the cradle's +X wall.
#   - Far from the wire-exit slot (which lives at link-x in [-15, -4]).
COXA_BRIDGE_GUSSET_H = 5.0   # mm -- gusset depth in -Z below arm bottom.
                             # Was 4 mm (matched the old arm_t = 4 mm).
                             # With arm_t = 6 mm the seated servo body
                             # top drops to link-z = -5.5, so we can go
                             # 1 mm deeper without violating insertion
                             # clearance.
COXA_BRIDGE_GUSSET_L = 23.0  # mm -- gusset length along the spar +X

# Coxa-link arm thickness in Z.  Originally 4 mm, raised to 6 mm to
# bring the arm's I = arm_w * arm_t^3 / 12 up by 3.4x for cantilever
# bending stiffness.  Bumping to 8 mm would clear the
# ``check_thin_sheets`` verifier directly but drops the servo-well
# by 1 mm (-> coxa_link clips the electronics tray in the
# workspace sweep) and squeezes the femur-pad-vs-bracket-flange
# margin from 1.25 mm to 0.25 mm.  Instead we keep arm_t = 6 and
# stiffen the +Y side of the arm with a top cap rib in
# ``make_coxa_link`` (see COXA_ARM_CAP_T below).
COXA_ARM_T              = 6.0    # mm -- arm slab thickness in +Z.

# Top cap rib stacked ABOVE the arm slab on the +Y side of the arm
# only.  Covers link y in [pad_y_min, arm_w/2] and link x in
# [hub edge, arm +X end].  Stays clear of the femur spar (which
# sits at link y in [-3, +3] at any pitch) and stays above the
# femur hip pad's max Z reach (pad swept disk reaches link z =
# hip_drop + HIP_PAD_R = -3.5 + 17 = +13.5 mm lifted, well below
# the cap bottom at z = arm_t + COXA_LIFT = 20 mm lifted).
#
# What this fixes: the ``check_thin_sheets`` cluster identifies the
# arm slab's +Y portion (cluster centroid at y = +1.2 mm, bbox y
# from -8.4 to +10.8 mm) as a 6 mm-thick (chord_z = 7.2 mm
# voxelized) structural neck between the yaw hub and the hip-pitch
# servo well.  Adding a cap on the +Y side raises chord_z to arm_t
# + COXA_ARM_CAP_T = 10 mm in the cap region.
#
# What this leaves unfixed: the y in [-3, +3] strip of the arm
# (where the femur spar swings through at extreme pitches) is NOT
# capped; a top cap there would collide with the spar at fem = -80
# deg (the firmware's negative-pitch joint limit).  The cluster's
# +Y half is fixed by the cap and the -Y half is already covered
# by the existing bridge / gusset structure (chord_z >= 10 mm in
# the bridge region).  The remaining "uncapped strip" voxels
# represent ~5/16 of the original cluster -- below the
# ``MAX_SHEET_BUDGET_VOX`` = 250 voxel budget.
COXA_ARM_CAP_T          = 4.0    # mm -- cap thickness in +Z above
                                  # arm.  Cap top at z = arm_t +
                                  # COXA_ARM_CAP_T = 10 mm unlifted,
                                  # lifted to z = COXA_LIFT + 10 =
                                  # 24 mm.

# ----- Well-top-wall thickening pad (coxa_link only) ---------------------
# Why this exists.  In the BASELINE ``make_coxa_link`` geometry the
# bridge slab that ties the horn yoke (top hub) to the hip-pitch servo
# well box overlaps the well's outer body by only 0.5 mm in Y (the
# 0.5 mm of bridge that punches past the well's outer +Y face) and
# 1.5 mm in Z (the 1.5 mm of bridge below the well's outer top face),
# giving a 53 x 0.5 x 1.5 = 40 mm^3 bonded interface holding the
# entire leg load.  ``pad_sweep_clear`` -- the cylindrical void that
# lets the femur hip pad swing through the link's interior -- then
# eats a circular hole through the bridge across most of its X span,
# leaving 19 mm^2 of bridge cross-section at the worst Z slice (just
# above the well top face, where the cylinder cut is widest).  The
# user has complained about this exact failure mode multiple times
# ("the top of coxa_link is not attached strongly to the part housing
# the servo, theres an obvious fix of thickening the wall on the
# motor housing so a bigger surface area attaches to the top piece").
#
# This pad is the user's preferred fix.  It's a rectangular block of
# plastic that sits ON TOP of the well's outer top face and rises up
# into the bridge gap, fusing both with the well's outer body (below)
# and the existing bridge / arm (above).
#
# Sizing notes (May 18 2026 revision).  An earlier 5 mm version of the
# pad left a 4.25 mm-wide safe spine outside the ``pad_sweep_clear``
# cylinder's y range of [-18, +18] -- BUT the bridge + pad at x ~
# COXA_LENGTH = +25 mm (where the cylinder cuts the deepest into the
# bridge gap) collapsed to a ~4 mm-thin vertical strip that the user
# flagged as visually + structurally "wrong wall thickened".  See the
# user-pointed screenshot at hexapod_walker/prototype/renders/
# _user_pointed_thin_neck.png and the ASCII diagnostic in
# _find_thin_neck.py (YZ slice at x = +22, x = +25): the surviving
# spine in the middle X range was only 4 mm wide in Y for a 6 mm-tall
# vertical column, which neither the original XY-slice bridge check
# nor casual inspection picked up.
#
# The fix is to extend ``WELL_TOP_PAD_Y_EXT`` to 13.25 mm so the pad's
# far-Y edge lands at y = -32 (= bridge_y_min - 13.25, = well_near_y -
# 13.75).  The pad's far-Y edge stays comfortably INSIDE the well's
# outer footprint (well's far-Y face is at y = -46.5) and OUTSIDE the
# cavity (the cavity sits at y in [-44, -6], BUT at z in [+2.5,
# +22.5] -- well below the pad's z range of [+23.5, +32], so the pad
# does not intrude into the cavity).  The new pad supplies ~14 mm of
# surviving safe spine in Y at every x in the bridge x range, holding
# the well to the bridge / arm / hub through ~14 x 8.5 = 119 mm^2 of
# cross-section at the cylinder-cut middle (vs. ~24 mm^2 with the
# 5 mm pad).
#
# Verified by ``_check_coxa_link_bridge_joint`` AND
# ``_check_coxa_link_bridge_yz_thickness`` in _verify_prototype.py
# (called as part of ``check_flimsy_joints``).  The YZ-thickness
# check FAILS on the 5 mm pad geometry (min YZ-area = 40 mm^2 at x =
# +22) and PASSES on the 13.25 mm pad.
WELL_TOP_PAD_Y_EXT = 13.25 # mm -- distance the pad extends PAST the
                            # bridge's existing -Y face into -Y
                            # direction (= INTO the well's outer body
                            # footprint).  See big docstring above.

# ---- Derived hip-pitch geometry ----------------------------------------
# Hip-pitch axis Z position in coxa-link local frame, AFTER lift.  Equal
# to (well_z_drop + COXA_LIFT) inside make_coxa_link, where
# well_z_drop = -(WELL_D/2 + COXA_ARM_T/2 + WELL_Z_DROP_EXTRA).  Exposed
# as a module-level constant so downstream callers (workspace tests,
# assemblies, renders, integrators) don't have to duplicate the formula
# (which got out of sync when WELL_Z_DROP_EXTRA was introduced).
# NB: + YAW_TOWER_RAISE lifts the hip-pitch axis in the coxa-local frame so
# the spaced yaw-bearing tower fits below it; CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z is lowered
# by the same amount so the WORLD hip-axis Z is unchanged (kinematics fixed).
# COXA_COAXIAL_FOOT_RAISE lifts the hip-pitch axis so the coaxially-stacked
# hip cradle's solid back seats on the hub.  The seated servo-body bottom
# (= hip-servo well floor) is at COXA_HIP_DROP - SERVO_BODY_D/2; we want
# that = yaw-hub platform TOP (YAW_HUB_PLATFORM_Z1, defined late)
# + COXA_WELL_FLOOR_LIFT.
#
# History: the two-part era stacked an 8 mm foot plate (COXA_JOIN_FOOT_T)
# ON TOP of the platform, putting the well floor at platform_top + 8 (+31)
# -- the sole Part A<->B bolted join needed its own thick slab.  Aug 17
# 2026 SINK PASS (user: the M3x30 heads were hard to reach down the 12 mm
# shafts; "push the bracket holding the servo down to overlap with the cap
# more ... making the height lower would help a lot getting the screws in
# and remove unnecessary material"): the link has been one piece since the
# Aug merge, so the separate raised slab serves nothing -- the foot now
# SINKS INTO the platform band (see make_coxa_hip_bracket), spanning
# z +18..+26.  The floor cannot drop all the way onto the platform top:
# the slab bottom is pinned at +18 (YAW_HUB_CAP_AXIAL_CL = 1.5 mm running
# gap over the stationary cap rim at +16.5 -- widened from 0.5 by the Aug
# 17 2026 bench scrape fix), and a flush floor left a 6 mm sheet carrying
# the whole cradle (flagged by the thin-sheet check, 43 x 40 mm cluster),
# so the floor sits COXA_WELL_FLOOR_LIFT = 2 mm above the platform top
# for the proven 8 mm slab.  Net: the cradle rides 5 mm lower, the screw
# heads sit ~5.3 mm below the shaft mouths instead of ~9, and the world
# hip axis drops 5 mm (58.65 -> 53.65 -- the verifier / sim re-derive the
# pose consistently).  The INNER bearing interfaces (boss, uflange, dust
# skirt) are untouched.
COXA_WELL_FLOOR_LIFT = 2.0   # mm -- well floor above the platform top
#
# Jun 2026 flush-horn refit: the platform top is no longer the literal 13.5;
# it tracks the bearing stack via YAW_TOWER_TOP_Z (= UPPER_race_top + lip).
# YAW_HUB_PLATFORM_Z1 = YAW_TOWER_TOP_Z + YAW_HUB_CAP_AXIAL_CL (boss over
# the cap rim -- 1.5 since the Aug 17 2026 scrape fix) + YAW_HUB_PAD_T (6)

# ---- Hip-bracket CENTERING on the yaw axis (Jun 2026 re-centre) ---------
# The user requirement: coxa_hip_bracket (Part B) must sit CENTERED RIGHT
# OVER THE YAW SERVO -- its body/footprint centred on the yaw axis (coxa
# x=0, y=0), a clean coaxial vertical stack, NOT cantilevered off to one
# side.
#
# The servo BODY is already centred in coxa-X (the STS3215 long axis spans
# coxa-X symmetric about 0 when x_dir=(1,0,0)).  The off-axis sprawl is
# entirely in coxa-Y: with the disc-horn-top (hip axis) anchored at y=0 the
# fixed side spans coxa-Y in
#     [JOINT_HORN_TOP_Z - WELL_H, JOINT_HORN_TOP_Z + PASSIVE_BACK_PLATE_T]
#   = [3.0, 48.3] mm  (centre +25.65),
# i.e. the whole servo tower hangs to +Y.  Anchoring the hip joint at
# COXA_HIP_ANCHOR_Y instead slides that footprint so its centre lands on
# the yaw axis (coxa y=0).
#
# KINEMATIC CONSEQUENCE (documented, intentional): the STS3215 output face
# is on ONE side of the body, so a body that is centred on the yaw axis
# necessarily puts the hip-PITCH axis at the body's -Y edge -- about
# |COXA_HIP_ANCHOR_Y| mm tangential (and COXA_LENGTH mm radial) from the
# yaw axis.  This is the unavoidable minimum offset (you cannot have BOTH
# the body centred AND the output exactly on the axis).  Every leg-
# kinematics consumer anchors the hip joint at (COXA_LENGTH,
# COXA_HIP_ANCHOR_Y, COXA_HIP_DROP) so the femur/tibia chain, the verifier
# pose grid, fasteners, mujoco and the assembly all stay consistent and
# the foot just lands at the (re-derived) tangentially-shifted stance.
#
# (The actual value depends on JOINT_HORN_TOP_Z / PASSIVE_BACK_PLATE_T,
# which are defined further down with the sandwich-joint geometry, so the
# assignment of COXA_HIP_ANCHOR_Y / COXA_HIP_ANCHOR lives just below them.)

# ---- Foot ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Aug 2026: the hinged foot is RETIRED.  The tibia now ends in a single
# TPU 95A ``foot_boot`` pressed (optionally epoxy-dabbed) straight over
# the Ø8 CF tube end -- no tibia_foot_fitting, no foot_pad, no M3x16
# pan-head hinge pin, no nyloc.  Rationale (user, Aug 2026 design
# review): the hinged pad's angled tang dug into the textured garage
# floor and caught; the loose hinge added 2 printed parts + 2 fasteners
# per leg and nothing measurable in traction.
#
# Aug 19 2026 DOME tip (user + GPT walking-gait review): the original
# boot ended in a FLAT Ø10 chamfer-rimmed face.  On the textured garage
# floor the flat tip caused BOTH observed failure modes -- whenever the
# tibia is not perpendicular to the floor (i.e. most of stance) the boot
# rides its chamfer EDGE: a tiny contact that catches texture ("stuck"),
# then breaks free all at once ("slips") -- exactly opposite to what the
# RL policy expects, because mujoco_prototype models the foot as a
# SPHERE of radius FOOT_BOOT_OD/2 tangent at the kinematic tip (smooth
# single-point contact at any leg angle).  The tip is now a
# HEMISPHERICAL DOME of radius FOOT_BOOT_OD/2 with its apex at the
# kinematic tip -- the physical foot IS the sim's contact sphere (dome
# centre lands at tibia-local x = TIBIA_LENGTH - FOOT_BOOT_OD/2 =
# mujoco's BOOT_TIP_CTR; no sim change needed).  The dome also deletes
# the print-orientation coupling: the boot now prints MOUTH-DOWN with a
# 45-deg internal blind-end cone (borrowed from the cone experiment) so
# nothing bridges.
#
# Boot local frame (same convention the old fitting used): origin at the
# tube end on the tube axis, tube enters from -X, ground tip toward +X.
# The dome APEX lands exactly at tibia-local x = TIBIA_LENGTH, so the
# 128 mm knee-axis→tip kinematic length is unchanged.

# Phi 14 sleeve of the production boot, whose tip was a flat Phi 10 face

# The bore's blind end is a 45-deg internal cone (not a flat face) so
# the boot prints MOUTH-DOWN -- wide stable base on the bed, and the

# Hinge geometry.
#
# May 2026 inversion: the foot/tibia hinge used to be "TIBIA = fork,
# FOOT = tongue" -- the tibia ended in a 2-cheek + 4 mm tongue-slot
# clevis (12 mm wide in tibia Y) and the foot_pad had a 4 mm-thick
# vertical tongue that slid up into the slot.  That made the tibia
# 12 mm wide in Y at the foot end but only LINK_THICKNESS = 6 mm
# wide everywhere else, so the clevis protruded 6 mm above the
# spar's broad face in the "spar broad face on bed" print orientation
# and forced supports under the clevis.
#
# After the inversion the geometry is "TIBIA = single tang, FOOT =
# fork": the tibia spar terminates in a single LINK_THICKNESS-wide
# tang centred on tibia y=0 (so the tibia is now 6 mm wide in Y
# EVERYWHERE and prints fully flat), and the foot_pad gains a 2-cheek
# fork with a LINK_THICKNESS + clearance slot that captures the tang.
# Same M3 x 16 pan-head pin + M3 nylock, same hinge axis -- just
# inverted geometry; no BOM change for fasteners.  The foot_pad's
# Y extent across the fork is 2 * FOOT_HINGE_CHEEK_T + SLOT_W =
# 2 * 3.5 + 6.4 = 13.4 mm, which fits comfortably within the disk's

# Aug 2026: the single 138 x 46 x 24 mm 3S pack in the inter-plate bay is
# RETIRED (it made the top deck unwieldy and would NOT fit under the
# belly -- verified by projecting every under-belly obstruction at the
# pack's Z band).  Replaced by TWO "shorty" 3S 2200 mAh packs (Zeee
# 75 x 34 x 26.5 mm, ~137 g each) wired in PARALLEL via an XT60 Y-harness
# and mounted UNDER chassis_bottom's flat belly (z = -6), side by side.
#
# Placement (chassis frame, verified against all 6 legs' servo + retainer
# footprints sliced over the pack Z band): block centred on the ORIGIN,
# long axis yawed +30 deg (pointing at the leg-0 edge-mid direction --
# the only orientation that fits; 0/60 deg clips the diagonal saddles).
# Exact-mesh clearance to the nearest retainer pole: ~5 mm.  XT60 leads
# exit the block's +axis end (r = 37.5 toward az 30) into the open
# pocket inboard of the leg-0 saddle (inboard edge r = 53).
#
# Retention: industrial hook-and-loop (Dual Lock) between pack tops and
# the flat belly, plus the CENTRE velcro-strap slot pair (x = -8,
# y = +/-26 -- cut for the old bay pack and kept) as a safety strap: its
# straight y-run crosses the middle of the 30-deg block, wrapping both

#     MEGA_HOLES below (asymmetric pattern; see Arduino's reference
#     drawing).  4 x M3 SHCS into 4 x M3 brass heat-set inserts
#     (McMaster 94459A130) embedded in printed tray bosses.  Replaces
#     the old Arduino Nano hole pattern; the firmware moved to the
#     Mega so the Nano is no longer on the BOM.
#
#   * Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (or Pi 5; same 85 x 56 mm footprint with
#     the same 49 x 58 mm 4-hole pattern at offsets PI_HOLES below).
#     4 x M2.5 SHCS into 4 x M2.5 heat-set inserts (McMaster
#     94459A106) embedded in printed tray bosses.  NEW -- no Pi
#     mounting existed before the May 2026 hardware-arrival pass.
#
#   * 2 x Adafruit PCA9685 16-channel PWM driver -- 62 x 25 mm PCB
#     with the standard 54 x 16 mm 4-hole pattern (PCA_HOLES below).
#     4 x M3 SHCS into 4 x M3 heat-set inserts per board.  May 2026
#     "essentials" pass: the second PCA9685 (was previously cable-

# sites) so the heat-set insert pocket has >= 1.5 mm of radial
# plastic.  The chassis-side mount holes still match the
# 35-mm-radius / 45-deg square pattern shared with chassis_bottom +
# chassis_top (and the arm baseplate, if present), with a Phi 5.5 mm
# x 3 mm-deep counterbore from the tray's TOP face so the chassis

# volumes for the Mega's USB-B + barrel jack and the Pi's USB-C /
# HDMI / USB-A / Ethernet stack ARE modelled (May 2026
# "essentials" pass) -- see ``cable_keepouts.py`` for the
# registry and ``_verify_prototype.check_cable_clearance`` for
# the verifier.  Each keep-out is a simple box extending from the
# connector face along the cable's natural exit direction; the

# the anti-spark switch's XT60 output and ~ 10 cm output pigtail to

#
# Cradle geometry summary:
#
#   * 2 BECs laid flat side-by-side along Y, BEC long axis (24 mm)

#         Y: 2 * BEC_BODY_W - BEC_CRADLE_INTERFERENCE (= 29.6 mm) so
#            the 2 BEC bodies share a 0.4 mm friction interference
#            fit across the inner span (no divider wall; the BECs

# ---- IMU pad (MPU-6050 vibration-isolated mount) ------------------------
#
# May 2026: the MPU-6050 / GY-521 was the last "optional" item in the
# parts list without a fixed mounting location.  Promoted to standard
# kit now that the Pi 4 / Pi 5 is on the robot (ROS 2 / Python brain
# expects orientation feedback for closed-loop body-attitude control on
# uneven terrain).
#
# Vibration isolation: the MPU-6050's HF gyro noise floor is very
# sensitive to high-frequency mechanical vibration, and brushed /
# digital hobby servos generate plenty of it.  The IMU must be
# MECHANICALLY DECOUPLED from the chassis -- bolting the breakout
# rigidly to chassis_top would feed every PWM-update jitter and tooth-
# slop pulse straight into the gyro.
#
# Damping strategy: a small printed pad (``imu_pad.stl``) carries the
# IMU on 4 x M3 brass heat-set inserts, and the pad ITSELF is glued
# to chassis_top via a 3 mm-thick strip of 3M VHB / generic double-
# sided mounting foam tape.  The foam tape doubles as the mount AND
# the vibration damper.  No fasteners between the pad and chassis_top.
#
# (Alternative considered: a 4-corner printed standoff with TPU 95A
# sleeves.  Mechanically nicer but complicates the build -- needs a
# second filament + a separate slicer profile for the TPU sleeves --
# and the foam-tape variant gets you 80 % of the damping with zero
# extra print effort.  See PROTOTYPE.md step 12 for the assembly
# rationale.)
#
# Standard GY-521 breakout PCB dimensions:
#
#     PCB:       21.2 x 16.4 x 1.6 mm
#     Holes:     4 holes in a 15.0 x 11.0 mm pattern, Phi 3.0 mm
#                clearance (most boards; a minority use Phi 2.5 mm --
#                we treat as Phi 3.0 for compatibility).
#     Header:    1 x 8-pin male header along one long edge (VCC, GND,
#                SCL, SDA, XDA, XCL, AD0, INT).
#
# Pad geometry (printed):
#
#     Floor:       IMU_PAD_W x IMU_PAD_D x IMU_PAD_T mm, flat smooth
#                  bottom for foam-tape adhesion.  Slightly LARGER
#                  than the IMU PCB so the foam-tape footprint
#                  extends past the board edges.
#     Bosses:      4 x Phi IMU_PAD_BOSS_OD mm cylinders at the IMU's
#                  15 x 11 mm hole pattern, rising IMU_PAD_BOSS_H mm
#                  above the floor's top face.  Each boss carries
#                  an M3 brass heat-set insert (McMaster 94459A130)
#                  in a Phi INSERT_M3_PILOT_OD x INSERT_M3_PILOT_DEPTH
#                  pocket opening DOWNWARD from the boss top.  The
#                  IMU PCB rides on the 4 boss tops; M3 x 8 SHCS
#                  thread DOWN through the PCB into the inserts.
#
# IMU_PAD_BOSS_H is deliberately TALLER than the (now retired)
# switch-holster boss pattern (5 mm vs 3 mm) so a full 6 mm-deep insert pocket fits
# ENTIRELY above the pad's bottom face.  With the standard 2 mm pad
# floor + 5 mm bosses = 7 mm total, the 6.4 mm pocket overdrill ends
# at z = 0.6 mm above the pad bottom, leaving the bottom face FLAT
# for foam-tape adhesion.  A nominal "3 mm boss" would leave the
# pocket overhanging the foam-tape face by 1.4 mm -- which is why
# the convention diverges from the cradle / switch_holster boss
# heights here.

    The manifold boolean kernel occasionally emits zero-area faces and
    vertices spaced finer than the float32-STL grid.  ``is_watertight``
    tolerates them in memory, but binary STL quantises to float32 and a slicer
    re-welds them into coincident/sliver faces -> NON-MANIFOLD edges that block
    slicing (Bambu Studio rejected chassis_bottom_lower with 29 such edges).

    Strategy, in order of preference:

      1. Route through ``manifold3d.Manifold.simplify`` -- this dissolves the
         sub-tolerance slivers while *guaranteeing* a 2-manifold result.  Adopt
         it only when it welds export-clean (``_is_export_clean``), stays
         watertight, and preserves volume -- so genuine assembly meshes
         (femur_link's CF-tube-in-bore gap, which is not a closed solid) are
         never silently mangled.
      2. Fall back to the legacy merge / drop-degenerate / drop-duplicate pass,
         adopted under the same guard.
      3. Otherwise return the mesh untouched.

    The volume guard is relative (<=0.5 %): a sliver-ridden raw mesh slightly

    fraction of a percent -- that is the corrected value, not lost material."""

    """Return ``(bosses_union, pockets_union)`` for the 4 cradle bolt
    sites in a cradle shelf (MIXED MODE -- Design E, May 2026).

    Local frame: matches ``_servo_well_solid`` (origin at the body's
    bottom face centre; +X = body long axis = tab-span direction;
    +Y = body short axis; +Z = output shaft direction).

    Two distinct schemes are emitted, one per X column:

      * ``sx == -1`` (the 2 -X bolts per cradle): HEAT-SET INSERT scheme.

        - Boss: a vertical Phi ``CRADLE_BOSS_OD`` cylinder centred on
          ``(sx * SERVO_MOUNT_HOLE_X_OFFSET, sy * SERVO_MOUNT_HOLE_Y_OFFSET)``,
          spanning well-z in ``[shelf_top_z - CRADLE_BOSS_HEIGHT_MM,
          shelf_top_z]``.  Unioned into the cradle so the printed
          material around the insert pocket is at least
          ``CRADLE_BOSS_MIN_WALL_MM`` thick radially.
        - Pocket: a vertical Phi ``INSERT_M3_PILOT_OD`` cylinder
          centred on the same (x, y) axis, spanning well-z in
          ``[shelf_top_z - INSERT_M3_PILOT_DEPTH, shelf_top_z + 2.0]``
          BY DEFAULT.  The pocket extends 2 mm ABOVE the shelf top so
          the boolean cut leaves a clean rim and 1 mm BELOW the
          insert length ``INSERT_M3_INSERT_LENGTH`` so debris from
          the heat-set installation has somewhere to go.  The pocket
          is subtracted from the cradle.

          The ``heatset_pocket_z_top_override`` arg lifts the
          pocket's TOP cut plane above the default shelf_top_z +
          2.0 mm.  Use this from the ``_chassis_yaw_cradle_solid``
          call site -- and ONLY there -- to drill the pocket UP
          through the cradle's non-load-bearing 5-mm shroud that
          caps the shelf between cradle-z = +6 (shelf top) and
          cradle-z = +11 (cradle rim, = CRADLE_BOSS_H_MM).  Without
          the override the 12 chassis_bottom heat-set pockets are
          fully CAPPED from above by ~3 mm of shroud material, and
          the operator has no opening from which to press the
          M3 brass insert (McMaster 94459A130) down into the
          pocket with a soldering iron.  See the ``CRADLE_BOSS_H_MM``
          constants block for the shroud's history (it used to wrap
          the gear housing at BOSS_H = 19 mm; Path-A dropped it to
          11 mm but left a 5 mm dust-shroud strip above the shelf
          which the heat-set pocket geometry never adapted to).
          User feedback (May 24 2026): "the bottom chassis really
          doesn't seem like it has the inside holes for the heat
          set inserts to hold the servo -- maybe they are covered
          so they are impossible to see? Either way I need a hole
          on the top to put the heat set insert into".  Confirmed
          via Z-sweep probe at the bolt PCD before the fix.

          The legacy ``_servo_well_solid`` cradles (coxa_bracket,
          coxa_link, femur_link, tibia_link) have NO shroud above
          the shelf -- their rims sit at well-z = WELL_RIM_Z which
          equals the shelf top -- so the default +2.0 mm overshoot
          suffices there and they pass ``shelf_top_z`` only.

      * ``sx == +1`` (the 2 +X bolts per cradle): SELF-TAP PILOT scheme.

        - No boss is emitted -- the Phi ``CRADLE_BOSS_OD`` = 8 mm boss
          footprint physically intersects the +X WIRE_CHANNEL that the
          servo's molded wire boot (Phi ``WIRE_BOOT_W`` = 7 mm in Y)
          has to pass through during insertion, so the heat-set boss
          cannot coexist with the channel on this column.
        - A bare Phi ``INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_PILOT_OD`` = 2.5 mm pilot is
          sunk straight into the existing well-wall material below the
          servo tab, spanning well-z in
          ``[shelf_top_z - INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_PILOT_DEPTH,
            shelf_top_z + 2.0]``.  The M3 x 8 SHCS self-taps into this
          pilot -- the surrounding plastic is the thread engagement
          medium, NOT a brass insert.

        See the ``INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_*`` constant block near the top of
        this file for the design rationale (mixed-mode Design E,
        May 2026: restored wire channel + +X self-tap fallback) and
        ``check_servo_insertion_path`` in ``_verify_prototype.py`` for
        the regression probe that catches the heat-set-boss-vs-boot
        collision if it ever recurs.

        The ``selftap_pocket_z_top_override`` arg behaves
        symmetrically to ``heatset_pocket_z_top_override`` above: it
        lifts the +X self-tap pocket's TOP cut plane above the
        default shelf_top_z + 2.0 mm.  The
        ``_chassis_yaw_cradle_solid`` call site passes this so the
        2 +X self-tap columns also open through the shroud cap,
        keeping all 4 bolt sites consistent (clean Phi-2.5 holes
        from rim to shelf top) and giving the bolt head 3 mm of
        head-room above the seated servo ear during installation.
        See ``heatset_pocket_z_top_override`` above for the full
        rationale -- the shroud above the +X column is identical
        to the shroud above the -X column.

    ``shelf_top_z`` defaults to ``WELL_RIM_Z`` (the nominal cradle rim
    height in well-local).  ``make_coxa_bracket`` passes a lower value
    when the bracket's drop-in slot has eaten the rim down by a known
    amount so its bolt-site bosses + pockets stay correctly aligned
    with the bracket's effective shelf top.

    ``heatset_pocket_z_top_override`` / ``selftap_pocket_z_top_override``
    both default to ``None`` which means "use ``shelf_top_z + 2.0``"
    (the legacy +2 mm clean-rim overshoot).  Pass a numeric value
    only from cradle call sites where the shelf is capped from above
    by a non-load-bearing shroud that has to be punched through to
    give the operator visual / mechanical access to the pocket --
    i.e., the chassis_bottom integrated yaw cradle and only that
    cradle.

    Use as::

        bosses, pockets = _servo_cradle_insert_pockets()
        body = _union(body, bosses)
        body = _diff(body, pockets)

    Caller responsibility: apply the same well-to-cradle ``R`` /
    translation chain to BOTH meshes so the boss/pocket pair lands on
    the bolt PCD in the cradle's local frame.

    History: this helper replaced ``_servo_cradle_pilot_holes`` (which
    returned only the 4 Phi 2.5 mm self-tap pilot cylinders) in the
    May 2026 heat-set switch (commit f03d59b).  Design E (May 2026)
    REVERTED the 2 +X sites to the Phi 2.5 mm self-tap scheme because
    the heat-set boss + restored wire channel cannot coexist on the
    +X column; the 2 -X sites kept the heat-set scheme intact.

    June 2026 STS3215 redesign
    --------------------------
    The DS3225 dropped INTO an open-topped bucket and hung from its side
    TABS on a shelf.  The STS3215 has no tabs; it bolts by 4x M2.5
    through a PLATE on its FRONT (output) face.  So the cradle is now an
    inverted bucket:

        - 4 side WALLS span z in [0, WELL_RIM_Z] (= body height) and
          locate the body laterally with WELL_BODY_CL clearance.
        - A front mount PLATE caps the top, z in [WELL_RIM_Z,
          WELL_RIM_Z + WELL_PLATE_T].  The body's front face seats flush
          against the plate underside at z = WELL_RIM_Z.
        - The plate carries the central output-coupling clearance bore
          and the 4x M2.5 (countersunk) case-screw holes on the 9.8 mm
          square around the output axis (see ``servo_mount_hole_centres``).
        - The cradle is OPEN at the BACK (-Z): the servo is slid in from
          behind and pushed forward against the plate, then the 4 M2.5
          drive in from the front (output) side.

    ``remove_floor`` is accepted for backward compatibility (the femur's
    supports-free print) but is a no-op now.

    Jun 2026 clamshell redesign (see the ``CLAMP_*`` constants block): the
    full front-face mount PLATE is gone.  The cradle is now open on the +Y
    long face (lateral drop-in) and open at the centre of the output face

    This is HALF of the legacy ``_wire_exit_slot()`` mesh.  The other
    half -- the inner +X wall channel that clears the molded wire
    boot during insertion -- is returned by ``_boot_clearance_channel()``.

    Background
    ----------
    DS3225-class hobby servos route their 3-wire harness out of a
    RECTANGULAR MOLDED BOOT on the body's **+X SHORT face** -- i.e. the
    SAME X-end as the output gear (which sits at +SERVO_OUTPUT_X).  The
    boot dimensions (WIRE_BOOT_* near the top of this file) are baked
    into ``_servo_envelope`` so this is visually unambiguous in renders.

    Function split rationale (May 2026, chassis_bottom yaw cradle
    redesign, commit 5.5/9)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    The legacy ``_wire_exit_slot()`` returned a single mesh that
    combined TWO independent functions:

      1. an L-shaped corridor through the EXIT face of the cradle that
         lets the wire bundle leave the cradle into open air, AND
      2. a vertical channel cut INTO the wall facing the wire boot
         (always +X by hardware) that lets the boot descend through
         the wall during servo insertion.

    These were bundled because for the legacy cradles (coxa_bracket,
    coxa_link, femur_link) BOTH ended up on the +X face and so could
    share a single boolean cut.  The chassis_bottom integrated yaw
    cradle moved the EXIT corridor to the radially-INWARD (-X) face
    (so the harness routes to the per-leg drop slot at chassis-frame
    +46.8, +27, +2) but the BOOT is still hardware-anchored to +X.
    Without separating the two functions, mirroring the legacy
    bundle to -X moved both pieces and left the +X wall solid in
    the boot's swept volume; real DS3225 servos could not be seated.

    Splitting the helper into two functions lets each cradle's
    builder mirror / translate / rotate the two pieces independently.

    The L-corridor must:

      * give the wire bundle a clean exit path through the chosen
        EXIT face (defaults to +X for legacy cradles; mirrored to -X
        by the chassis_bottom yaw cradle), AND
      * give the bundle a downward drop path through the well floor
        at the corridor's inboard end (so a harness that bends 90 deg
        at the boot can drop out the bottom of the cradle without
        sharing the boot's swept volume).

    Use as::

        well = _servo_well_solid()
        corridor = _wire_exit_l_corridor()
        # apply the same R / mirror / translation to corridor as to the well
        body = _diff(body, corridor)

    PRE-2026 versions of this file put the slot on the **-X side** of
    the well (opposite the output gear) on the incorrect assumption
    that the wires emerged from the back of the case.  That left the
    boot punched against solid +X wall material and the slot punched
    against solid +X cavity material -- the user could not seat the
    servo body fully in the cradle without bending or shearing the
    boot.  Fixed by mirroring the slot to the +X face that matches
    the boot.
    """
    # X span: from the body's +X face (inboard end of the slot, slightly
    # inside the cavity so the slot opens cleanly into the cavity wall)
    # out past the well's outer +X face by WIRE_SLOT_X_PAST_WALL so the
    # bundle exits into free air.
    slot_x_min = +SERVO_BODY_W / 2.0 - WIRE_SLOT_X_INBOARD
    slot_x_max = +WELL_W / 2.0 + WIRE_SLOT_X_PAST_WALL
    slot_x_extent = slot_x_max - slot_x_min
    slot_x_centre = 0.5 * (slot_x_min + slot_x_max)

    slot_y_extent = WIRE_SLOT_W                 # centred on y = 0

    # Z span: must reach BELOW the well floor (to give the downward escape
    # path) AND reach UP at least past the top of the wire boot
    # (WIRE_BOOT_Z_BASE + WIRE_BOOT_H) plus a comfortable margin -- we use
    # WIRE_SLOT_DEPTH which already includes that headroom for a molded

def _boot_clearance_channel() -> trimesh.Trimesh:
    """Cutting volume for the vertical channel on the INSIDE surface of
    the +X wall that lets the servo's molded wire boot descend through
    the wall during INSERTION.

    Local frame: same as ``_servo_well_solid`` / ``_servo_envelope``.

    This is the SECOND half of the legacy ``_wire_exit_slot()`` mesh.
    The first half -- the L-shaped wire-EXIT corridor on the chosen
    exit face -- is returned by ``_wire_exit_l_corridor()``.  See
    that function's docstring for the May 2026 chassis_bottom yaw
    cradle redesign rationale that motivated the split.

    The channel cuts INTO the +X wall material from the cavity face
    (so it merges seamlessly with the body cavity) out to
    ``WIRE_CHANNEL_DEPTH`` into the wall.  The +X anchor is FIXED by
    hardware (the DS3225 / MG996R / DS3218-class boot always points
    +X in well-local coords) and so this helper does NOT get mirrored
    along with the L-corridor when the EXIT face changes -- each
    cradle's builder applies whatever transforms it needs to the
    L-corridor INDEPENDENTLY of this channel.

    Channel-vs-boss reroute history (May 2026)
    -------------------------------------------
    The May 2026 heat-set switch (commit f03d59b) shortened the
    channel's top from ``WELL_RIM_Z + WIRE_CHANNEL_TOP_OVER_RIM =
    +29.5 mm`` down to ``(WELL_RIM_Z - CRADLE_BOSS_HEIGHT_MM) -
    0.5 = +16.5 mm`` so the channel cut would not graze the new
    Phi CRADLE_BOSS_OD = 8 mm heat-set bosses at
    (+SERVO_TAB_HOLE_PCD/2, +/-SERVO_TAB_HOLE_PCD_Y/2) =
    (+24.75, +/-5).  That worked for the SEATED boot
    (z ~= [4.1, 8.0] in body-local, comfortably below the new
    16.5 mm cap) but BROKE the INSERTION path: the boot has to
    slide DOWN through the +X wall from z = WELL_RIM_Z + boot_h
    (above the rim) all the way to its seated z, and the 10.5 mm
    of +X wall material between z = 16.5 and z = WELL_RIM_Z =
    27.25 stopped the boot from descending past the rim.  Real
    DS3225 servos could not be seated in their printed cradles.

    Fix (Design E, May 2026 mixed-mode): restore the channel cap
    to its pre-f03d59b value (``WELL_RIM_Z +
    WIRE_CHANNEL_TOP_OVER_RIM``) so the boot has the full
    insertion path AND switch the 2 +X heat-set sites per cradle
    to Phi 2.5 mm M3 SELF-TAP pilots (no boss), since the
    restored channel would have eaten the inboard half of each
    +X boss.  Detailed rationale + alternative options
    considered live in the INSERT_M3_SELFTAP_* constant block
    near the top of this file; the verifier's
    ``check_servo_insertion_path`` probe catches this regression
    if it ever ships again.

    The 2 -X bolts per cradle KEEP their heat-set inserts.  For
    the LEGACY cradles (coxa_bracket / coxa_link / femur_link)
    the wire-exit corridor stays on +X (no mirror) so the -X
    column has no channel cut and the -X bosses keep their full
    8-azimuth radial wall.  The NEW chassis_bottom integrated
    yaw cradle mirrors the L-corridor to -X (so wires route
    radially inward toward the per-leg harness drop slot), which
    puts the L-corridor's lateral leg through the -X column;
    the -X heat-set bosses there get the channel-side wall
    reduction documented in the ``CRADLE_BOSS_*`` constants
    block: 25 percent (8/32) of the 1.5-mm-min radial-wall
    azimuths get punched out by the mirrored corridor.  See that
    constants block + the ``check_cradle_insert_pockets``
    preamble for the engineering judgement that retaining 75
    percent of the boss circumference + the plate-bonded boss
    bottom leaves >> 5x the actual servo-tab clamping load on
    each insert.

    ``_servo_cradle_insert_pockets`` builds heat-set bosses ONLY
    on the -X sites; the +X sites get a bare Phi 2.5 mm pilot
    column in the wall material that the boot's swept volume
    passes cleanly through.

    held by its side ears on a shelf, heat-set inserts + a molded wire
    boot) is replaced by a TOWER that carries an elevated FRONT-FACE
    mount plate.  The STS3215 has no tabs; it bolts via 4x M2.5 through
    a plate on its FRONT (output) face.  The yaw servo's output points
    UP; the servo is inserted from BELOW (open bottom), pushed up until
    its front face seats against the plate underside, then fixed with
    the 4 M2.5 case screws driven down through the plate.  The output
    coupling pokes up through the plate's central bore and the dia-20
    disc horn seats on the plate TOP; the coxa_link mounts on the horn
    at ``CHASSIS_YAW_OUTPUT_Z`` (pinned to the DS3225 value so the leg-
    mount height / kinematics are unchanged).

    Used by ``make_chassis_bottom`` which iterates the 6 leg azimuths
    via ``_leg_chassis_frames`` and unions one cradle per leg into the
    hex plate.  The shell footprint is 1 mm proud of the plate's
    ``WELL_W+2 x WELL_D+2`` body cutout on each side so the boolean
    union bonds the tower walls into the plate around the cutout.

        captured from below by the bolt-on ``yaw_servo_retainer`` stirrup
        (which anchors into 2 M3 pilots in the floor) so it cannot drop out.

    """TOP half of the SPLIT yaw-bearing tower (Jun 2026 insertion fix).

    The single-piece chassis tower bored 37 -> 34 -> 37 -> 34 and trapped
    BOTH 6706 outer races between Phi 34 constrictions, so neither race could
    reach its seat -- physically un-assemblable, yet the static CAD validated
    the seated state.  The tower is now split at the lower race's top face
    (coxa-local z = YAW_SPLIT_Z = -1); the BOTTOM half (in ``chassis_bottom``)
    holds the lower race in an open-top pocket, and THIS bolt-on cap holds the
    UPPER race.

    Coxa-local frame (z = 0 = disc-horn top), coaxial with the yaw axis --
    identical to ``make_coxa_yaw_hub`` so the same per-leg placement transform
    positions both.  Vertical layout:

        z[-1, +6]    Phi 37 CLEAN through-bore (radial housing for the upper
                     outer race; NO sub-Phi-37 constriction below the race)
        z[+6, +7]    Phi 34 inner RETAINING LIP -- a thin shoulder the upper
                     outer race seats UP against, holding the bearing in (the
                     lip clears the Phi 32 rotating inner race / hub uflange)
        z[-1, +3]    3 x M3 outboard ear lugs (bolt DOWN into the tower pilots)

    (Jun 2026: the bottom register wrap-lip at z[-3.5, -1] was removed -- it
    was a thin, hard-to-print floating ring; the two halves are now kept
    concentric by the 3 join bolts seating into the tower pilots.)

    ASSEMBLY (Jun 2026 assemblability fix): the cap is LOWERED straight down
    over the upper outer race already seated on the hub boss, so the bore is
    Phi 37 all the way DOWN from the lip to the split plane.  The retired Phi 34
    NECK (which capped the LOWER race + seated the upper race from BELOW) was an
    85.5 mm^3 hard stop on that descent -- see ``check_bearing_cap_descent_path``.
    The new Phi 34 lip is the OPPOSITE feature: it sits ABOVE the seated race
    (z[+6, +7]) so the cap clears the race all the way down and the lip only
    lands on the race TOP at full descent -- positive axial retention with no
    descent hard stop.  The upper bearing is now POSITIVELY held: located
    axially by its inner race against the hub uflange (z=+6) + the M3 disc-horn
    clamp preload, and capped by this lip on the outer race.  The lower
    (floating) outer race is held by the tower press-fit + its z=-5 plate seat.

    The 3 M3 head counterbores are cut as COMPLETE circles up through the (now
    +7) ring rim: since the bolt circle (PCD 47) is ~1.5 mm outboard of the
    Phi 44 ring OD, each head pocket carves a small scallop into the ring wall,
    giving the screw head a clean full-circle seat + clear driver access from
    above instead of being crowded by the taller ring wall.

# -- user: "copy that same part to be on the coxa link as well so I can
# screw into the servo from both sides") -------------------------------------
# The knee cradle holds its servo by the clamp cap + lip + the 4 front-case
# self-tappers on the OUTPUT side only (its end-face bolts were dropped in
# Jul 2026 -- the fused spar covers that wall).  This tab hangs under the
# OPEN back (idler) face and picks up the servo's rear molded screw-hole
# PAIR nearer the -X (spar / hip-yoke) end -- body-frame
# (SADDLE_CASE_HOLE_X2 + SERVO_OUTPUT_X = -20.3, +/-10.2), the same hole
# family the yaw saddle self-taps -- with 2x M2.5 x 6 self-tappers
# (PN 96877A150, ~2.5 mm bite into the ~2.8 mm molded pilots).  The pair
# nearer the output end (+4.2) is left OPEN so the back-face 5264 connector
# bay / bus harness stays unblocked (user).  Clearances: the tab stays
# z >= -FEMUR_REAR_TAB_T = -5.5 with the heads FLUSH in their recesses (see
# the head-recess note below), the swinging tibia arm's inner face passes
# at z = -7 (~1.5 mm running clearance), and the reachable tibia-spine sweep
# sector never points at the -X azimuth (the well walls already stand
# there).  The +Y corner is relieved 0.25 mm below the knee clamp cap's

# THE 4 mm BUMP, clarified (Aug 15 2026 bench photo, user: "4 mm ... this is
# absolute max 4 mm and should probably be 3.5 to give some tolerance for the
# bump on the sts motor on this side" / "this green part sticks out too far"):
# the bump is ON THE BACK FACE, not just the end flare.  Measured from the
# servo's -X (wire) END FACE across the back face there is only a short FLAT
# recessed ledge -- it carries the rear molded hole pair (centres 2.4 mm
# in) -- and then the case shell STEPS UP (~1.8 mm proud, the raised centre
# platform around the 5264 bay).  Any printed tab lying on the back face must
# stop on that ledge, else it lands on the step and the screws can never pull
# it flush.  Aug 17 2026 bench remeasure with the tab printed (user: "make
# [it] 1 mm longer? It has a tiny bit more space"): the flat ledge is a hair
# under 5 mm, not the ~4 mm read off the photo, so the reach grew 3.5 -> 4.5
# past the end face (x <= -18.2).  That retires the open KEYHOLE compromise
# of the 3.5 mm tab: the Phi 2.7 holes (rims at -18.95) are now fully
# ENCLOSED with 0.75 mm of rim wall, and the Phi 4.6 pan head overhangs the
# +X edge by only 0.2 mm (effectively fully seated), still in free air BELOW
# the step (head bears at z = -3.5; the step only reaches -1.8).
#
# HEAD RECESS (Aug 17 2026, user: "you also need to have room to countersink
# the screw head on the side with two holes just like on the side with four
# holes"): the tab is 2 mm THICKER than the screw shank and each hole gets a
# Phi 5.2 straight counterbore 2 mm deep from the outer face, so the Phi 4.6
# pan head sits FLUSH in a pocket (like the output plate's 4 countersunk
# case screws) instead of proud.  The counterbore floor stays at z = -3.5 =
# -SADDLE_CASE_SHANK, so the clamp shank (3.5 mm of plastic under the head)
# and the 2.5 mm self-tap bite into the ~2.8 mm molded pilot are UNCHANGED --

# out in the pilot.  The outer face moves to z = -5.5; the swinging yoke

# REINFORCED-YOKE TEST VARIANT (Aug 2026 v3, after the bench yoke-bend
# incident).  The weak member is the SPINE -- the plate connecting the two
# clevis arms (user, after v2: "you dont need to reinforce the arms, you
# need to reinforce the plate connecting the arms").  The evidence agrees:
# the arms are bolted flat onto the disc horns (well supported), the load
# path BETWEEN them is the 4 mm spine plate, twisting/bending of which is
# exactly what lets the arms go non-parallel -- and the tibia yoke's spine
# plate is the part that actually CRACKED in the field (see
# TIBIA_YOKE_SPINE_PAD_T above).  v3 therefore:
#   * DOUBLES the spine plate to YOKE_SPINE_T_REINF = 8 mm total on EVERY
#     yoke (the tibia already ships 8 mm from the crack fix; the variant
#     brings the femur hip yoke to match).  Growth is OUTBOARD only
#     (x 46 -> 50) -- inboard is forbidden by the Jun 2026 clamp-cap ROM
#     refit (the spine face at x 42 clears the swept cap by 0.39 mm).
#     Plate bending/torsion stiffness ~ t^3 => ~8x.
#   * KEEPS the triangular root fillets at the arm/spine inner corners --
#     they reinforce the plate-to-arm junction where the yield started.
#     Z-legs differ per corner because the measured swept gaps differ:
#     below the BOTTOM arm face (-7) the servo rear boss tops out at -4
#     (3 mm gap -> LZ 2.5); above the TOP arm face (41.3) the HIP's coxa
#     deck plate sweeps to z 39.3 across r 14-30 (2 mm gap -> LZ 1.5).
#   * Arms stay stock 4 mm (v2's 7 mm arms retired: they stiffened the
#     wrong member and needed +3 mm horn screws).
# History: v1 (outboard drum "closed yoke", ~23 g/joint) and v2 (7 mm
# arms) are retired; each stiffened something other than the plate that
# fails.
#
# Where reinforcement may live was measured, not guessed
# (tools/_closed_yoke_diag.py sweeps the REAL fixed-side meshes through the
# joint ROM in the yoke frame, +5 deg margin each end):
#   * Outboard of the spine, |phi| <= ~45 deg about +X is free out to
#     r ~ 39.5 (hip-limited); the 8 mm plate's corners reach r 39.4 --
#     the same envelope the tibia crack-fix pad already occupies.
#   * A hoop closing the open (-X) end is IMPOSSIBLE at any radius (the
#     incoming femur spar / coxa arm sweeps that half-space out to
#     r ~ 90 mm over the ROM); side webs near the arm edges are blocked by
#     the clamp-cap corner sweep (r <= 29.1 mm across phi +/-105 deg).

# ONE-PIECE printed femur (Jul 2026) -- yoke + spar + knee bracket, one body
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# History: the femur segment started as a cut Phi 8 CF tube, then became a
# separate printed Phi 7.8 drop-in strut (Jun 2026, user: "the femur tube is
# so ridiculously short and cutting the carbon fiber is kind of a pain"),
# then the strut was fused into the hip yoke leaving a slip-fit + single-pin
# joint at the knee bracket (Jul 2026 merge #1, user: "combine femur hip yoke
# and femur strut into one stronger femur hip yoke part").  Jul 2026 merge #2
# (user: "combine the femur knee bracket with the femur hip yoke and make
# that connection very solid (cylinder size of our diameter)"): the knee
# bracket is fused in too, so the WHOLE FEMUR is one printed part --
# ``femur_link`` -- and the yoke-to-bracket connection is a SOLID
# Phi FEMUR_SPAR_OD cylinder spanning the full inter-well gap.  No socket
# bore, no slip fit, no retention pin: the printed cross-section between
# the joints is solid Phi FEMUR_SPAR_OD (18 since Aug 2026) everywhere.
# Assembly is unaffected -- both ends still attach via bolted disc horns
# (hip) and the drop-in servo + clamp caps (knee).  The longer 130 mm
# tibia stays a CF tube between two separate printed fittings.
FEMUR_SPAR_LEN = FEMUR_LENGTH - _YOKE_SOCKET_X - WELL_W / 2.0
                 # yoke-spine face to knee-bracket well wall (~19 mm).
FEMUR_SPAR_OD  = LEG_TUBE_OD + 10.0
                 # Phi 18 (Aug 2026, user: "make the connector coming out of
                 # it thicker").  Was Phi 14 = the old socket-boss OD from the
                 # Jul 2026 merge; 18/14 in solid bending stiffness ~ (18/14)^4
                 # = 2.7x.  Still SOLID, no bore.  Clearance: the exposed spar
                 # (x >= the 8 mm spine's outer face at 50) never dips below
                 # planar r 37.5 from the hip axis vs the clamp-cap sweep at
                 # r <= 29.1, and Phi 18 (z 8.15..26.15, y +/-9) stays inside
                 # the knee well wall's y +/-16.9 / z 0..34.3 face.
_FEMUR_SPAR_WALL_BITE = 1.0   # mm the spar extends INTO the knee well wall
                              # so the boolean union is volumetric (not a
                              # coincident-face contact); stays well clear of
                              # the servo cavity behind the 6 mm wall.
# Aug 2026: field crack #2 -- a femur knee well crack one week after the
# identical tibia socket-wall crack.  (First read as radiating from the
# spar landing; the user corrected that -- the split actually runs along
# the FAR wall, see the FEMUR_KNEE_FARWALL_PAD_* block below, which is
# the fix for the crack itself.)  The spar junction cones kill the sharp
# 90-deg T-junctions where the spar meets the yoke spine and the knee
# well wall: torque-reaction FEA shows the near-wall junction is the
# highest-stressed region of the whole part under a 2g foot strike --
# every bending moment funnels through that re-entrant corner (Kt ~ 3)
# across the FDM layer seams (the part prints spar-horizontal).  Each
# cone: base radius buried _FEMUR_SPAR_WALL_BITE into the spine / wall,
# apex exactly at the OPPOSITE junction face, so it tapers past the
# Phi 18 spar ~3 mm out (a small ~73-deg flare) and NEVER pokes through
# the far wall / spine into the clamp-cap or clevis airspace.
# History of the per-end radii:
# * KNEE end R = 12 since the first Aug 2026 study (base on the 9 mm well
#   wall backed by the whole well box; FEA: junction stress -31%).
# * HIP end was R = 0 while the spine was the stock 4 mm plate: FEA
#   showed a stiff cone rim prying that thin plate (7.7 MPa hot zone at
#   the rim, worse than the 5.3 MPa corner it replaced).  Later in
#   Aug 2026 the user asked for the yoke bar to be thickened and a small
#   taper "on both sides": the femur spine is now a DOUBLED 8 mm plate
#   (FEMUR_YOKE_SPINE_PAD_T), which removes the thin-plate objection, so
#   the hip cone is reinstated at the same R = 12 -- re-checked by FEA
#   against the 8 mm plate (see artifacts/strength/femur_tq_*).
FEMUR_GUSSET_R_HIP  = 12.0  # mm -- cone base radius at the hip spine face
FEMUR_GUSSET_R_KNEE = 12.0  # mm -- cone base radius at the knee well wall

# Aug 2026 (user: "thicken the bar between the two arms ... on the femur
# link"): the femur hip yoke's spine plate -- the bar connecting the two
# clevis arms -- is DOUBLED 4 -> 8 mm, growing OUTBOARD x 46 -> 50 exactly
# like the tibia yoke's crack-fix pad (TIBIA_YOKE_SPINE_PAD_T) and the v3
# reinforced-yoke variant (YOKE_SPINE_T_REINF); the same _closed_yoke_diag
# survey that cleared those clears this (outboard |phi| <= 45 deg free to
# r ~ 39.5; the 8 mm plate's swept corner reaches r ~ 39.4).  The spar and
# both gusset cones root on the new x = 50 outer face.
FEMUR_YOKE_SPINE_PAD_T = 4.0   # mm added OUTBOARD to the femur yoke spine

# Aug 2026, crack-location correction (user: "the crack was against the
# other wall"): the field crack is NOT at the spar landing -- the photo
# shows a layer-seam split just under the clamp-cap seam wrapping the
# FAR (+X well-local) wall corner, the wall OPPOSITE the spar.  A
# torque-reaction FEA (knee moment = F_impact * TIBIA_LENGTH ~ 1.8 N-m
# applied as the servo's bearing couple on the well walls + cap-pilot
# pull, artifacts/strength/femur_tq_*) shows why: pure knee torque only
# puts ~2 MPa in that wall, but a LATERAL foot catch reacts its
# out-of-plane moment as an ~80 N bearing couple of the servo case
# against the far wall's TOP band plus a pull against the retaining
# lip -- 5..17 MPa at the wall top / plate junction, marginal against
# PETG LAYER-ADHESION strength (well under the 22.7 MPa derated bulk
# yield, but the load pries straight across the seams, and the Phi 2.5
# cap-bolt pilot pre-stresses the same section).  Fix: an external
# BUTTRESS PAD (a doubler) on the far wall's outer face over the WALL
# BAND ONLY, z in [0, WELL_RIM_Z] -- STOPPING at the plate underside.
#   * FEA-tuned height: a first full-height pad (flush with the plate
#     top) halved the wall stress but hard-coupled the lateral couple
#     into the 4 mm top plate -- its drop-in-slot edge strip went +65%
#     (p95 9.8 -> 16.3 MPa), the same stiff-addition-moves-the-hot-spot
#     lesson as the abandoned hip-end spar cone.  Stopping the pad at
#     the plate underside keeps the wall doubled (far-wall mid-section
#     p95 1.48 -> 0.81 MPa, region peak 17 -> 9.7; pilot vicinity -70%;
#     lateral-case global peak 36 -> 16 MPa vs 22.7 derated yield) with
#     the plate strip unchanged from baseline.
#   * T = 3.5 (1 mm bite into the wall for a volumetric union).
#   * half-Y: FULL wall width (WELL_D/2 = 16.9) since the Aug 2026
#     flatten pass (user: "this top can just be a flat wall with no
#     weird cutouts") -- the outer face is now ONE flat rectangle over
#     the whole wall band instead of a raised 26 mm pad ("two layers of
#     a wall").  Clearances re-checked at full width: the pad's swept
#     corner (r ~28.3 about the knee axis) stays inside the cap
#     flange's existing r ~29.1 sweep envelope, and its +Y face is
#     exactly COPLANAR with the wall end face the cap flange seats on
#     (no overlap; mesh_overlap guards it).  The z span still STOPS at
#     the plate underside (WELL_RIM_Z) -- that is the FEA lesson above,
#     not a styling choice: the remaining small step under the 4 mm top
#     plate must stay.
# The same Aug 2026 pass DELETED the wire-exit L-corridor + boot channel
# from the knee cradle (``_sandwich_fixed_side(wire_exit=False)``): the
# real STS3215 exits its bus cables via the BACK-face 5264 ports through
# the sandwich's open back (see the WIRE_BOOT_* legacy note), so the

    """goBILDA 1906 Series 25T aluminum servo hub (visualization mesh).

    Source: https://www.gobilda.com/1906-series-lightweight-servo-hub-25-tooth-spline-32mm-diameter/
    SKU:    1906-0025-0032 ("1906 Series Low-Profile Servo Hub, 25-Tooth
            Spline, 32 mm Diameter"; aluminum, clear-anodized; 4.7 g; $4.99)

    Why this exists (user report, May 2026):
        The OEM plastic 4-arm X-horn that ships with hobby servos
        (``make_servo_horn``) strips its spline after a few load cycles
        at the hexapod's femur joint.  This aluminum hub is the
        higher-torque replacement.  Using it requires redesigning the
        link mounting pad -- the goBILDA bolt pattern is a 16 mm SQUARE
        (M4 at +/-8, +/-8) which is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the
        current ``DISC_HORN_BOLT_PCD`` = 14 mm disc-horn cross PCD that the
        link pad mates against -- so this factory is offered in parallel
        to ``make_disc_horn`` and the assembly/inspector still call the
        disc horn for now.

    Local frame (matches ``make_servo_horn``):
        +Z = servo output shaft axis
        Origin at the BOTTOM face (the spline-engagement side that mates
            to the servo).  Top face sits at z = GOBILDA_1906_HUB_H.

    Modeled features:
        * Main hub disc: Phi GOBILDA_1906_HUB_OD = 32 mm, height
          GOBILDA_1906_DISC_H = 4 mm, spanning z = [0, 4].
        * Top centering boss: Phi GOBILDA_1906_BOSS_OD = 14 mm, height
          GOBILDA_1906_BOSS_H = 2 mm, on top of the main disc spanning
          z = [4, 6].  This is goBILDA's 14 mm "centering mechanism for
          mating components that have a 14 mm bore."
        * Central 25T spline female bore: Phi GOBILDA_1906_SPLINE_OD =
          6 mm (smooth cylinder; the real part has 25 internal spline
          teeth that we DON'T draw because this is a visualization mesh).
          Modeled as a blind pocket from the BOTTOM face spanning the
          full main-disc thickness (z = [0, GOBILDA_1906_DISC_H]) so
          the spline engages the servo output shaft.
        * Central M3 cap-screw clearance hole: Phi HORN_CENTRE_OD =
          3.4 mm, drilled THROUGH the full hub from bottom to top so the
          servo's M3 spline-cap screw passes through.
        * 4 x M4 threaded holes: Phi GOBILDA_1906_M4_OD = 4.3 mm
          (clearance for the M4 screw; the real hub is tapped M4),
          at (+/-GOBILDA_1906_BOLT_GRID/2, +/-GOBILDA_1906_BOLT_GRID/2)
          = (+/-8, +/-8) mm from the spline centre.  Important: the
          bolts sit at radius sqrt(8^2 + 8^2) ~= 11.31 mm, which is
          OUTSIDE the 14 mm boss footprint (boss radius = 7).  So the
          M4 holes can only tap into the 32 mm DISC's flat top
          shoulder, not the boss -- modeled as blind pockets going
          DOWN GOBILDA_1906_M4_DEPTH = 3 mm from the disc top face
          (z = GOBILDA_1906_DISC_H = 4 mm), spanning roughly z = [1, 4]
          inside the main disc.

    Returns:
        A single watertight ``trimesh.Trimesh`` ~32 mm OD x 6 mm tall.

    NOTE: This is a VISUALIZATION mesh.  Don't use it for printable-part
    fit checks: spline teeth are omitted, hole positions are nominal,
    and the boss/disc step is an estimate (the goBILDA product page
    doesn't publish a sectional dimension drawing).  When goBILDA's
    STEP file is available offline, prefer it for any production check.

    Intentionally SMALLER than the bottom plate (CHASSIS_TOP_FLAT_TO_FLAT
    = 140 mm vs CHASSIS_FLAT_TO_FLAT = 200 mm).  The bottom plate carries
    the structural load (it sandwiches the coxa brackets and takes their

    holder, electronics tray and optional arm.  The smaller hexagon keeps
    the top plate inside a 70 mm apothem so the legs' hip-pitch wells +
    femur hip pads sweep clear of it across the full joint workspace

    proud, with M3 heat-set inserts -- are RETIRED.  The user velcros
    the holster to the deck, so the plate top face is completely flat.)

    Yaw-shaft pass-through cutouts (May 2026 chassis-bottom-integrated
    yaw-cradle redesign):

      The redesigned yaw-servo cradle sits inside ``chassis_bottom``
      and routes the servo's output spline UP toward chassis_top.  In
      the legacy ``coxa_bracket`` design the spline + X-horn stack
      lived ENTIRELY below the bracket flange (chassis-z <= +20),
      below chassis_top's bottom face (chassis-z = +22 at the Aug 2026
      20 mm gap; +32 historically); no top-plate hole was needed.  Under the
      new design the spline still terminates at chassis-z = +20
      (= cradle-z +6 tab shelf + SERVO_BODY_H - SERVO_TAB_Z + spline
      length), but the project's CAD convention is to add an explicit
      pass-through cutout in chassis_top for any output shaft whose
      AXIS is below the top plate, so the design intent is documented
      in code instead of relying on a footprint-aware reader.

      Geometry: 6 x Phi (DISC_HORN_OD + 2 mm) = Phi 22 mm cylindrical
      cutouts -- 1 mm radial clearance on the Phi DISC_HORN_OD = 20 mm
      disc horn / coxa yaw-hub stack that rotates on the yaw axis --
      placed at the yaw-axis locations (= chassis hex edge midpoints,
      apothem 100 mm).  The cylinders have height ``CHASSIS_PLATE_T * 4``
      mm for a clean through-cut.  (Sized to DISC_HORN_OD, NOT the
      Phi 10 mm output gear stack: if chassis_top ever grew to reach the
      yaw axis, the 20 mm disc horn -- not the spline -- is what must
      clear it.)

      Geometric reality: chassis_top's hex perimeter sits at apothem
      = CHASSIS_TOP_FLAT_TO_FLAT / 2 = 70 mm, so the 6 yaw axes at
      apothem 100 mm are 30 mm OUTSIDE the plate's footprint.  The
      Phi 22 mm cylinders cut empty air; the diff is a geometric
      no-op against the current chassis_top hex.  Kept as an active
      diff so a future enlarged chassis_top (say apothem 110 mm) will
      automatically gain the clearance holes without a code change.
      The runtime cost of 6 empty diffs is negligible (well under
      1 ms in trimesh's CSG path).

    buckets.  ``make_chassis_bottom`` builds the real printed part by cutting
    everything below ``CHASSIS_SPLIT_Z`` off this solid (discarding the deep
    buckets, keeping the flat plate + cradle WELL walls + tower) and folding a
    flat floor slab onto the underside.  This solid is NOT printed and is NO
    LONGER the verifier's assembled reference -- the cradle-feature probes now
    load the REAL merged ``make_chassis_bottom`` (via the ``chassis_assembled``
    key) so they test the part that actually prints.  Its one remaining
    standalone use is as the known-bad flat-bottom fixture in
    ``check_flat_bottom`` (the deep buckets MUST be rejected by the guard --
    see ``_flatbottom_check.py``).

    Structural carrier for the coxa-bracket flanges and the brass
    standoff columns (44-mm-radius diagonal pattern via
    ``with_chassis_standoffs``).  Jul 2026 battery-fit rework: the
    tray-mount bosses + heat-set insert pockets + centre holes at
    ELEC_CHASSIS_MOUNT_HOLES_XY and the battery_holder foot-bolt
    pattern + hex-key access bores are all DELETED -- the in-gap
    electronics_tray and the clip-in battery_holder are both retired,

    * Each leg gets a small ``LEG_HARNESS_DROP_X_EXTENT`` x
      ``LEG_HARNESS_DROP_Y_EXTENT`` mm slot cut THROUGH the plate just
      INBOARD of the body cutout (long axis = chassis radial = bracket
      +X), so the leg's 3-cable harness can drop from the cradle side
      of the plate into the inter-plate volume without sharing the
      body cutout with the seated yaw servo body.  Applied by
      ``_hex_plate`` via ``with_leg_harness_drops=True``.  The slot
      itself is also the per-leg zip-tie anchor: the assembler loops
      a zip-tie through the slot to bundle the 3-cable harness as it
      makes its U-turn from the cradle wire-exit into the inter-plate
      volume.  (A previous revision printed a vertical anchor tab
      below the plate; it was retired in May 2026 to keep the plate's
      bottom face flat for easier FDM printing -- see the

# Chassis-bottom FLOOR -- single merged part (Jun 2026)
# ===========================================================================
# Forensic context: ``_flatbottom_check.py`` proved the ORIGINAL single-piece
# chassis_bottom did NOT print flat -- the 6 integrated yaw-servo cradle
# buckets hung ~20.5 mm BELOW the main hex plate, so the part rested on 6
# small rings (~16% bed contact) with the whole 200 mm plate floating as a
# support-needing overhang.  That drove a temporary HIGH/LOW print split.
#
# The LOW half was then simplified to a plain flat hex slab (the deep buckets
# were abandoned; the yaw servo is retained by the bolt-on
# ``yaw_servo_retainer`` capture stirrup instead).  At that point the split
# was VESTIGIAL: the HIGH half already prints flat (bearing tower up, broad
# flat underside on the bed), so the horizontal split bought nothing.
#
# So the two halves are MERGED back into ONE printed ``make_chassis_bottom``:
# the flat plate + everything above it, plus a solid flat FLOOR slab
# (``_chassis_bottom_floor_solid`` -- the old LOW plate, minus all the now-dead
# join hardware) folded onto its underside.  The result is a single part whose
# perimeter is ~8 mm thick with a broad flat -6 mm bed face -- still flat-bottom

    Three steps:

      1. take the full integrated solid (``_chassis_bottom_full_solid``: the
         flat hex plate + the upward yaw-bearing tower +
         ``yaw_bearing_cap`` interface + the 6 yaw cradles + velcro/battery

         that used to hang ~20.5 mm down, leaving the flat plate + the cradle
         WELL walls above the cut + the bearing tower -- a broad flat -2 face.

      2. fold a solid flat FLOOR slab (``_chassis_bottom_floor_solid``, the old
         LOW plate minus all join hardware) onto that underside, z in
         ``[-6, -2]`` (overlapping the plate by 1 mm for a clean volumetric

         cutouts + harness-drop slots + the 2-per-leg ``yaw_servo_retainer``
         self-tap pilots.

      3. re-cut the 3 pairs of battery velcro-strap slots through the merged
         solid so a strap can still loop under the (now thicker) plate.

    The yaw servo body passes down through the floor's body cutout and hangs
    below the chassis; the bolt-on ``yaw_servo_retainer`` capture stirrup bolts

    GEOMETRY
    --------
    A solid regular hex prism, outer footprint = the chassis hex
    (``CHASSIS_FLAT_TO_FLAT``), spanning z in
    ``[CHASSIS_SPLIT_Z - CHASSIS_BOTTOM_FLOOR_T, CHASSIS_SPLIT_Z + 1]``
    (= [-6, -1]).  The nominal floor is [-6, -2]; the extra +1 mm overlaps the
    plate so ``make_chassis_bottom``'s union is a clean volumetric merge rather
    than a fragile coplanar kiss.

    Functional negative space (ONE batched diff -- no coplanar-faced unions, so
    nothing for the boolean kernel to shred):
      * 6 per-leg servo-body clearance cutouts (sized to the servo BODY +
        ``WELL_BODY_CL``, == the cradle's own body cavity -- NOT the larger
        ``WELL_W+2 x WELL_D+2`` well) so each yaw servo body passes down through
        the floor and hangs below while the floor still fills in UNDER the
        cradle walls to keep the -6 bottom face flush/flat for printing;
      * 6 per-leg harness-drop slots (the serial-bus wire exits);
      * 4-per-leg ``yaw_servo_retainer`` self-tap pilots (blind, opening at the
        -6 bottom face) in solid plate material on the tangential flanks of
        each body cutout, in two radial rows (Jul 2026 4-point anchor rework).

    NO join hardware: the HIGH/LOW split is gone, so the 12 join-bolt
    counterbores/clearances + 6 register dowels of the old LOW plate are
    deleted.

    STRUCTURAL 6-FOLD (C6) SYMMETRY
    -------------------------------
    ONE canonical 60-deg sector of cutters (one leg's body cutout +
    harness-drop slot + the 2 retainer pilots) is built ONCE, then replicated
    by an EXACT ``k * 60 deg`` rotation about the central Z axis for
    ``k = 0..5`` -- every leg is bit-identical up to its rotation and the hex
    prism is itself C6.  ``check_c6_symmetry`` probes THIS slab (the
    C6-bearing portion of the merged chassis_bottom); the full chassis_bottom
    legitimately breaks C6 only via the off-centre battery/electronics
    features, which live in the plate above, not in this floor.

          2.0 mm counterbore from the tray's TOP face.  The cbore
          depth is INTENTIONALLY shallower than ELEC_TRAY_T = 3 mm so

          chassis_bottom's tray-mount boss (see ``make_chassis_
          bottom`` for the TRAY_MOUNT_BOSS_* geometry).  May 2026
          tray-mount fix: cbore depth was 3.0 mm before; the tray-
          mount audit caught that the cbore ate the full tray

    breakout (May 2026 "essentials" pass: IMU promoted from optional to

    Pi 4 / Pi 5 layout per the published mechanical drawings:

      * -Y LONG edge (chassis -Y after placement; cables exit -Y
        past chassis_top's -Y apothem):
          - USB-A 3.0 PAIR (blue, 2 stacked) ~ 16 x 16 x 17 mm
          - USB-A 2.0 PAIR (black, 2 stacked) ~ 16 x 16 x 17 mm
          - Ethernet RJ45                     ~ 16 x 16 x 14 mm
      * -X SHORT edge (chassis -X after placement; cables exit -X
        in a separate corridor from the +X PCA9685 servo header
        bank):
          - USB-C power           ~ 8 x 12 x 8 mm
          - 2 x micro-HDMI        ~ 8 x 8 x 12 mm each
          - (3.5 mm audio jack omitted -- not used in this robot)
      * +Y LONG edge: 40-pin GPIO header (no jumper cables modelled).
      * +X SHORT edge: micro-SD slot (user reaches in to swap; no
        plug, no keepout needed -- the card sits low on the PCB).

    Mesh frame: origin = PCB midplane.  +X = long axis (PI_PCB_W,
    chassis +X after placement).  +Y = short axis.  +Z = up.

    Pre-May-2026 the visual mesh had USB-C/HDMI on the +Y LONG edge
    and USB-A/Ethernet on the +X SHORT edge -- physically impossible
    for the real Pi (USB-A x2 + Ethernet would overflow the 56 mm
    short edge).  The May 2026 "Pi cantilever" pass corrected the
    bank-to-edge assignment AND fixed the Ethernet RJ45 jack
    out-of-plane height from 25 mm to 14 mm (the 25 mm figure
    confused the in-plane plug depth with the actual ~ 13.5 mm-tall
    metal jack body + ~ 1-2 mm metal EMI shield on top).

        +X = arm direction (outboard at neutral pose).

    Layout (May 2026 aggressive +Y-overhang removal, follow-up to
    407e191):

        Viewed from +Y the link is an L-shape: cap at the -X end,
        plank-shoulder + bridge stacked on the cap's -Y edge, and the
        well + well-top pad hanging off the +X end.  All material at
        y > bridge_y_max = -10.5 AND z > PEDESTAL_CAP_T = +4 is now
        removed -- this excised the +Y half of the pedestal column
        (was the full 34 x 34 mm pillar up to z = COXA_LIFT = +36)
        AND the +Y arm slab over the pedestal.

        - Pedestal CAP: 34 x 34 mm slab at z in [0, PEDESTAL_CAP_T] =
          [0, +4], hosting the 4 M3 disc-horn bolt counter-bores + the
          central M3 horn-screw counter-bore + the disc-horn collar
          recess.  The cap retains its full 34 x 34 footprint
          (= +Y half is NOT trimmed at z < +4); only y > -10.5 above
          the cap is removed.
        - Assembly trough: the 34 mm wide (y in [-17, +17]) x
          ~57 mm long (x in [-21, +36]) x ~21.5 mm tall (z in [+4,
          +25.5]) servo-insertion void at the centre of the link
          hollows out the entire pedestal column directly above the
          cap.  Pre-existing; the +Y-overhang trim adds nothing here
          (the column above the cap was already hollow in the body's
          +Y assembly-insertion sweep).
        - Pedestal -Y plank-shoulder: ~34 x 6.5 x ~10.5 mm wall at
          x in [-17, +17], y in [-17, -10.5], z in [~+25.5, +36].
          The surviving -Y slice of the pedestal ROOF (above the
          trough, below the lifted body slab) after the y > -10.5
          trim.  Carries yaw torque from the cap's -Y edge (which
          touches the well's outer -Y wall at the cap plane) up
          into the bridge.
        - Bridge: ~53 x 6.75 x ~14.5 mm slab at x in [-12, +41],
          y in [-17.25, -10.5], z in [+27.5, +42].  Bonds the
          plank-shoulder top to the well-top pad and the arm.
        - Arm slab: at y in [-11, +11], z in [+36, +42] before the
          trim.  The y > -10.5 portion was trimmed away in May 2026;
          only the y in [-11, -10.5] sliver survives and is now
          geometrically MERGED with the bridge's +Y face (no
          standalone "arm" exists in +Y any more).
        - Hip-pitch servo well: hangs in -Z below the arm at the
          +X end.  Open-topped (well +Z) is mapped to link +Y so the
          servo can be DROPPED in from the +Y direction during
          assembly.  The well's -Y outer wall (at y ~ -17, z in
          [0, +29]) is the primary load path that ties the cap
          (z in [0, +4]) to the bridge / pad / arm above the trough.
        - Well-top pad: 58 x 11.75 x 8.5 mm slab at x in [-14, +44],
          y in [-22.25, -10.5], z in [-8.5, 0] (un-lifted) = lifted
          z in [+27.5, +36].  Entirely at y <= -10.5 so it survives
          the +Y overhang trim untouched.
        - Cable post: tucked at y ~ -42 / x ~ +45 / lifted z ~ +41.
          Well outside the trim box.

        Strength (PETG beam): pre-trim SF for coxa_link was 44.11
        (Apr 2026 strength model).  Post-trim SF is reported in
        the strength check; expect it to drop by a wide margin (the
        new load path is the ~6.5 mm-thick -Y plank-shoulder + the
        well's -Y outer wall, not the previous 34 x 34 mm column),

    # (at link y in [-3, +3] at any pitch, since the spar's Y
    # extent is +/-LINK_THICKNESS/2 and rotation about Y does not
    # change the spar's link Y range) can still swing freely

    # pad's swept disk (radius HIP_PAD_R = 17 mm about (COXA_LENGTH,

    # rotationally symmetric about its femur Y axis) reaches a

    # link x range that depends on the pitch angle.  At any
    # NEGATIVE femur_pitch the spar's top edge crosses the arm's
    # bottom face somewhere between coxa-link x ~ +12 (at theta
    # = -80 deg, just past the hub's +X edge at +17) and coxa-link
    # x = arm_x_max = +41 (at theta ~ -10 deg).  In every case the
    # crossing happens on the spar centreline (femur y near 0), so
    # we cut a Y-narrow slot through the arm plate + outboard hub
    # at y in [-LINK_THICKNESS/2 - 0.5, +LINK_THICKNESS/2 + 0.5] =
    # [-3.5, +3.5] (LINK_THICKNESS-wide plus 0.5 mm FDM clearance on
    # each side).  The slot starts inboard at x = +8 (a few mm
    # INBOARD of the worst-case crossing point so the spar enters
    # the slot cleanly at theta = -80 deg) and ends outboard at x =
    # arm_x_max + 1.0 = +42 (a mm of overhang to make sure boolean
    # CSG punches through the arm's +X face).
    #
    # IMPORTANT (workspace-sweep fix): at theta = -80 deg the spar's
    # TOP flange (femur z = +17) also dips inboard + DOWN into the
    # PEDESTAL roof (the slab of coxa-link material above the
    # assembly trough at z in [trough_z_max, COXA_LIFT] =
    # [body_top_z + 1, COXA_LIFT]) at coxa-link x ~ +10..+17 and
    # z ~ +24..+32.  This is INSIDE the pedestal +X half (pedestal
    # x in [-17, +17]) and ABOVE the trough, so pad_sweep_clear
    # (radius HIP_PAD_R + 0.5 = 20 mm) does not catch it (the
    # collision sits at coxa-link distance 21.6 mm from the hip
    # axis, just OUTSIDE the pad disc).
    #
    # The fix is to extend the spar slot DOWN through the pedestal
    # roof so it meets the trough.  The slot is y-narrow (7 mm) and
    # lives only at x in [+8, +42] (so |y| > 3.5 of the pedestal +
    # both -X halves stay fully solid), and it intersects the +X
    # half of the pedestal only over x in [+8, +17] -- the rest of
    # the slot is outside the pedestal in air.  See
    # check_workspace_self_collision for the failing-pose dump that
    # picked these coordinates.
    # ---- Hip pad/neck swept-clearance cut through pedestal + hub ----
    # The femur's hip pad + neck-torus is a SOLID-walled cylinder of
    # OUTER radius HIP_PAD_R = 19.5 mm around the hip-pitch joint axis,
    # spanning femur y in [-LINK_THICKNESS/2, +LINK_THICKNESS +
    # HORN_STACK_H] = [-3, +15].  Across the runtime hip-pitch range
    # the pad's swept silhouette in coxa-link (x, z) is the same disk
    # of radius HIP_PAD_R about (COXA_LENGTH, ?, hip_drop) regardless
    # of pitch (the pad is rotationally symmetric about the hip-pitch
    # axis).  That disk reaches inboard to coxa-link x = COXA_LENGTH -
    # HIP_PAD_R = 25 - 19.5 = +5.5 mm, INSIDE the pedestal's +X face
    # (at x = +17 for the 34 x 34 pillar) and the hub's +X face (at
    # x = +17 as well).  Without a clearance cut the pad disk physically
    # overlaps the pedestal-solid region (z >= trough_z_max) by ~200-
    # 500 mm^3 even at neutral pose, which check_self_collision flags
    # as a coxa_link-vs-femur_link clash.
    #
    # The cut is a SHORT cylinder along the +Y axis, centred on the
    # hip axis at (COXA_LENGTH, 0, hip_drop) (the well_z_drop +
    # COXA_LIFT plane), with radius HIP_PAD_R + 0.5 (0.5 mm FDM
    # clearance).  Y extent originally spanned the entire pedestal +
    # hub stack (link y in [-17, +17]) so the cut punches cleanly
    # through both.
    #
    # Heat-set boss carve-out (May 2026): the cut's -Y end at link
    # y = -18 used to reach 1.25 mm past the well rim plane (which

    # therefore eat the top 1.25 mm of each +X heat-set boss (boss
    # top at link y = -16.75, boss bottom at link y =
    # -16.75 - CRADLE_BOSS_HEIGHT_MM = -26.75).  Since the femur's
    # actual hip pad only sweeps at coxa-link y in [+9, +15] (the
    # pad sits at the OUTPUT side of the hip-pitch joint), the cut's
    # -Y reach can be safely trimmed back to the well rim plane plus

    # ---- Drop BOTH arm "stringers" over the slot --------------------
    # Before this cut, the spar_slot above leaves the arm slab as TWO
    # 7.5 mm-wide parallel stringers running over the outboard half of
    # the link: a +Y stringer at link y in [+spar_slot_y_half, +arm_w/2]
    # = [+3.5, +11] and a -Y stringer at y in [-arm_w/2, -spar_slot_y_half]
    # = [-11, -3.5].  Each stringer is 7.5 mm (y) x arm_t = 6 mm (z) x
    # ~34 mm (x in [+8, +42]), i.e. a 7.5 x 6 cross-section.
    #
    # The -Y stringer is STRUCTURALLY REDUNDANT with the bridge
    # immediately below it.  The bridge spans link y in
    # [bridge_y_min, bridge_y_max] = [~-17.25, -10.5] and z in
    # [bridge_z_min + COXA_LIFT, arm_t + COXA_LIFT] = [~+27.5, +42]
    # (lifted) over the FULL arm_x_extent = 53 mm.  Its cross-section
    # is bridge_y_extent x bridge_z_extent = ~6.75 mm (y) x ~14.5 mm
    # (z) = ~98 mm^2, more than 2x the stringer's 7.5 x 6 = 45 mm^2
    # and with a much taller Z (= bending stiffness ~ z^3) -- the
    # bridge carries ALL hip-pitch reaction load on the -Y side.
    # The stringer is just a redundant top cap that adds plastic
    # mass + print time + a print-orientation-trapped overhang above
    # the bridge with no structural payoff.
    #
    # The +Y stringer is the MIRROR of the -Y stringer, but unlike -Y
    # there is no mirrored +Y bridge to back it up: the hip-pitch
    # servo well opens to +Y for assembly insertion (the well's +Y
    # "wall" is just air -- the servo body slides in/out along link
    # +Y), so the geometry CANNOT host a +Y bridge.  The user has
    # ACCEPTED the resulting ~10x torsion / lateral stiffness drop
    # on the +Y side (no remaining hub-to-well member outboard of
    # the inboard arm slab at x < +8) in exchange for the geometric
    # cleanup -- the inboard arm slab + the -Y bridge + well_top_pad
    # are now the SOLE hub-to-well load path (the Design F gusset
    # cap above the bridge at z in [+36, +42] was dropped in the
    # same cleanup as the hub).
    #
    # X / Z_MIN: reuse spar_slot_x_min, spar_slot_x_max, spar_slot_z_min
    # verbatim so each trim void is co-planar / co-bordered with the
    # spar slot at every face we share (no FDM "kissing" sliver of
    # plastic between the cuts).
    #
    # Y_MAX (or Y_MIN, for +Y) and Z_MAX diverge from spar_slot for the
    # SAME reason on both sides: spar_slot was sized to JUST CLEAR the
    # femur spar through-cut (y in [-3.5, +3.5] = LINK_THICKNESS + 1 mm
    # FDM clearance, z up to COXA_LIFT + arm_t + 0.1 = +42.1, i.e. the
    # arm top after the Design F hub drop).  Each side's cut has to
    # remove the FULL stringer + the cap slab sitting on top of it
    # (arm_cap_neg at y in [-arm_w/2, -LINK_THICKNESS/2] = [-11, -3]
    # and arm_cap_pos at y in [+LINK_THICKNESS/2, +arm_w/2] = [+3,
    # +11], both at z in [arm_t + COXA_LIFT, arm_t + COXA_ARM_CAP_T +
    # COXA_LIFT] = [+42, +46]).  Two adjustments per side:
    #
    #   * Inner-Y bound = +/- LINK_THICKNESS/2 = +/- 3 (not +/-
    #     spar_slot_y_half = +/- 3.5) so the trim covers each cap
    #     half's FULL y range.  The 0.5 mm overlap with spar_slot at
    #     |y| in [+3, +3.5] is a deliberate redundant cut: at z in
    #     [+42.1, +46] (above spar_slot_z_max = +42.1) the cap's
    #     |y| in [+3, +3.5] strip is NOT removed by spar_slot, and
    #     without this 0.5 mm overlap it would survive as a
    #     free-floating ~25 mm^3 sliver after we wipe out the
    #     stringer + cap's main body.
    #   * Z_MAX = arm_t + COXA_ARM_CAP_T + COXA_LIFT + 0.1 = +46.1
    #     (not COXA_LIFT + arm_t + 0.1 = +42.1) so each trim cuts
    #     its cap cleanly through the top face.
    #
    # Cap-volume coverage by these trims:
    #
    #  * arm_cap_pos was retired from the union in May 2026 (only
    #    its local-variable definition survives for documentation);
    #    the +Y trim's z up-to-+46.1 over-reach is therefore strictly
    #    redundant on +Y (slices through air above the arm's +Y top
    #    face) but harmless.  Originally the +Y trim's structural job
    #    was to excise the +Y stringer at x in [+8, +42], y in [+3,
    #    +11], z in [+25, +42] (= outboard arm only, mirroring spar
    #    slot's x range).  A follow-up to 4995d4f (May 2026) extended
    #    the +Y trim's x range BACK over the pedestal to x in [-12.5,
    #    +42]: the over-pedestal slab at link x in [arm_x_min, +7],
    #    y in [+3, +11], z in [+25, +42] was un-bonded plastic mass
    #    (nothing on the +Y side of the link ties to it), so removing
    #    it shrinks the part without touching any load path.  The arm
    #    -X end therefore now looks like the bridge / well / pad
    #    layout on -Y: -Y half intact + bridge + well + pad, +Y half
    #    trimmed back to the y in [0, +3] centre strip.  See
    #    arm_pos_y_trim_x_min below for the boolean detail.
    #
    #  * arm_cap_neg IS still in the union, but its [+15, +41] x
    #    range is entirely inside the -Y trim's [+8, +42] x range
    #    AND its [+42, +46] z range is entirely inside the trim's
    #    [+25, +46.1] z range, so arm_neg_y_trim currently still
    #    eliminates the -Y cap volume even with arm_cap_neg in the
    #    union (the cap is geometrically dead for the same reason
    #    arm_cap_pos used to be).  We keep arm_cap_neg in the union
    #    so the symbolic load-path documentation matches the design
    #    intent ("-Y cap remains as -Y stiffener") and so that a
    #    follow-up shrink of arm_neg_y_trim's z_max down to arm_t +
    #    COXA_LIFT (= +42) would restore the cap WITHOUT any other
    #    code change.  (See the May 2026 +Y-cap retirement commit.)

    Local frame (May 2026 collinear-pad refactor):
        Origin: pad mating face (= disc-horn-top plane that the hip pad
                bolts down onto).  The hip-pitch joint axis (= servo
                spline tip) lives at link y = -HORN_STACK_H = -5 mm,
                HORN_STACK_H mm BELOW the local origin along link
                -Y.  Pre-refactor the origin used to be on the joint
                axis with the pad raised to y = +HORN_STACK_H, which
                made the link an L-shape in side view (pad above
                spar by 8 mm).  The new convention puts pad + spar
                in the SAME y range so the link reads as a single
                flat in-line beam.
        +X = spar long-axis (hip-end at x=0, knee-end at x=FEMUR_LENGTH)
        +Y = pitch joint axis direction; points AWAY from the disc horn
             into the link body.  Pad spans y in [0, +LINK_THICKNESS]
             = [0, +6] and the spar spans y in [0, +LINK_THICKNESS]
             = [0, +6] -- same range, no L-shape.  The knee servo
             well and any bridge ribs that hang off the spar's
             underside live in y < 0.
        +Z = perpendicular to spar, in the leg's plane of motion

    Hip end: a flat 4-bolt pad that bolts to the hip-pitch servo's
    20 mm aluminum 25T disc horn.  This pad is perpendicular to Y (lies
    in the X-Z plane), with its -Y MATING FACE at y = 0 and its +Y
    outer face at y = LINK_THICKNESS.  A Phi HORN_CENTRE_OD = 3.4 mm
    (M3 clearance) hole is drilled through the pad's centre along
    +Y so the servo's central spline screw can be installed /
    tightened / loosened from above (the pad's outer face) with
    the link already bolted to the disc horn -- user-flagged May 2026:
    without this hole the spline screw is captive under the link's
    mating face and the link has to be fully unbolted to access
    the spline screw.  Mirrors the coxa_link's pedestal-cap centre
    hole that gives the same access for the yaw spline screw.

    Knee end: an open-topped servo cradle that holds the knee servo,
    output shaft pointing +Y (parallel to the hip-pitch axis), so
    the tibia can be horn-driven and rotates in the same plane the
    femur does.

    Crucially the spar must NOT block the knee servo body's
    insertion path.  The body is 40 x 20 mm in cross-section and
    must be slid in along the +Y direction past the spar to reach
    the well; if the spar's z-extent overlaps the body's z-extent
    in the body's x-range, the body cannot be inserted at all.
    We solve this with two design tricks:

        1. The spar is taller than the body's short dimension
           (FEMUR_SPAR_H = 30 mm, SERVO_BODY_D = 20 mm), so cutting a
           20-mm-tall slot through it leaves 5-mm-thick top/bottom
           flanges that still tie the hip end to the knee end.
        2. We cut an insertion slot through the spar at the knee
           servo's x-range, and use two bridge flanges (above and
           below the body's z-extent) to connect the spar's flanges
           to the well's top and bottom walls.

    The femur prints with the spar's spar-Y axis vertical -- a flat
    plate 130 mm long, 30 mm tall, 6 mm thick -- so it lies on the
    build plate with no overhangs.

    Knee cradle floor: OPEN (May 2026 supports-free refactor)
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    The knee cradle (``_servo_well_solid`` rotated to point its mouth
    in femur +Y) is built with ``remove_floor=True`` so the floor
    frame at well-local z in [-WELL_FLOOR_T, 0] is cut out entirely.
    Why: in the "spar broad face on bed, mouth-down" print orientation
    used by the slicer, the well's mouth (femur +Y) faces DOWN onto
    the build plate and the well's floor faces UP -- a ~30 x 40 mm
    closed slab becomes a BRIDGED CEILING printed in midair.  The
    floor was purely a cosmetic seal: the servo body's load path is
    the 4 side walls (X / Z bounds), the tab shelf at z=WELL_RIM_Z
    that the servo's mounting tabs rest on, and the 4 boss columns
    that anchor the cradle bolt sites.  None of those depend on the
    floor.  After the cut the cradle is a 4-wall "pen" open on BOTH
    Y faces (mouth +Y and former-floor -Y); the body's -Y face is
    exposed to free air pointing AWAY from the chassis in the
    assembled robot.  No equivalent change for the coxa_bracket yaw
    cradle or the coxa_link hip cradle -- those print in different
    orientations where their floors are NOT bridges.

    #   * Pad outer face is at NEW y = +LINK_THICKNESS = +6 (was OLD y = +11)

    #     lives in world coordinates that map to NEW y in
    #     [-HORN_STACK_H, 0] for the disc and y < -HORN_STACK_H for the

    #       (femur y = -16.75) and the tibia-mounting clearance zone

    #     does NOT extend past this plane in +Y, so the well walls are

    #   - The structural members that DO live at femur y > -16.75 are
    #     the spar (y in [-3, +3]), the hip-end pad/neck cylinder (only
    #     at x ~ 0, the hip end, far from the knee), and these bridges.
    #   - Earlier bridge_y_max = +2.5 put the bridge cap's +Y face

    #     for the well-to-spar bond (well's +X face is at femur x ~=

    # ---- (Removed) lightening holes through the spar -----------------
    # Earlier revisions drilled 2 x Phi 13 mm cross-spar holes between
    # the hip pad and the knee-end body cradle ("for weight + zip-tie
    # tie-down").  At HIP_PAD_R = 20 mm the first hole's outer rim
    # (x_centre ~ 17 -> x_extent [10.5, 23.5]) lands within 0.1 mm of
    # the then-current M2 X-horn bolt at angle 0 deg (x = 10.4, z = 0,
    # on the retired 20.8 mm PCD) -- the
    # lightening hole eats half the bolt's clearance sleeve and leaves
    # the screw naked on its +X side.  See the analogous tibia code
    # below where the holes sit well away from the foot pin and any
    # bolt circles; on the femur there is no clean place to put them
    # without intruding on the hip pad bolt circle.  We forgo them.
    # The 90 mm femur spar is not heavy enough to require lightening.

    # ---- Knee-end clearance void for the tibia's pad/neck annulus ----
    # The tibia's knee-pad + neck-torus is a Phi (2 * HIP_PAD_R) = 39 mm
    # cylinder centred on the knee axis (femur x = FEMUR_LENGTH = 90),
    # spanning tibia y in [-LINK_THICKNESS/2, +HORN_STACK_H + 6] =
    # [-3, +15] = femur y in [-3, +15] (rotation about Y preserves Y).
    # The tibia rotates relative to the femur about the knee Y axis, so
    # the swept silhouette of the tibia pad + neck-torus in femur (x, z)
    # is a Phi 39 mm DISK about (FEMUR_LENGTH, _, 0).  At any non-trivial
    # knee pitch (including STANCE_TIBIA_DEG = +60 deg) the tibia neck
    # punches deep into the femur's spar / bridge volume -- without a
    # clearance cut the tibia knee-pad neck +X tip enters the femur's
    # +Y spar top flange (z >= 11 mm, the post-insertion-slot top
    # flange) and registers as a ~ 800 mm^3 self-collision in
    # check_self_collision.
    #
    # The cut is a Phi (HIP_PAD_R + 0.5) * 2 = 40 mm cylinder along
    # +Y, centred on (FEMUR_LENGTH, 0, 0), spanning femur y in
    # [-LINK_THICKNESS/2, HORN_STACK_H] = [-3, +9] -- exactly the
    # tibia's neck-torus y range (we don't need to clear the pad's
    # y in [+9, +15] zone because the pad sits ABOVE the femur's spar
    # and bridge volume in Y).
    # Use a slightly larger clearance radius (+2.5 mm vs the tibia
    # neck's nominal +0.5 mm clearance) to absorb voxel-stair-step
    # discretisation along the tibia neck's curved boundary AND to
    # account for the tibia's swept volume actually being a CYLINDER
    # of radius HIP_PAD_R + 0.5 (the neck-torus outer wall plus the
    # 0.5 mm horn-stack clearance applied to the OUTER boundary by
    # voxelisation).
    # NEW (May 2026 collinear-pad refactor): the tibia's pad + spar
    # now share the same y range (tibia y in [0, +LINK_THICKNESS] =
    # [0, +6]), and the tibia is placed at NEW femur (FEMUR_LENGTH,
    # 0, 0) so the swept volume in NEW femur y is at [0, +6] (rotation
    # about Y preserves Y).  Carve a Phi (2*(HIP_PAD_R+2.5)) = 45 mm
    # cylinder along +Y centred on (FEMUR_LENGTH, +LINK_THICKNESS/2,
    # 0) with 1.5 mm margin per side so the tibia clears the femur's

    # ---- Tibia knee-pose clearance cuts in the bridges ---------------
    # User report (May 25 2026): "when the tibia link is at a 90degree
    # angle to femur link the tibia link hits material at high Y and
    # low Z on the femur link, need to remove that".
    #
    # Geometric reasoning:
    #   The tibia pivots about the knee axis (femur +Y line through
    #   (FEMUR_LENGTH, *, 0)) and at a +90 deg knee angle the tibia
    #   spar (x in [0, TIBIA_LENGTH], y in [0, LINK_THICKNESS]=[0,+6],
    #   z in [-TIBIA_SPAR_H/2, +TIBIA_SPAR_H/2] = [-9, +9]) maps to
    #   femur (x = 90+tibia_z, y = tibia_y - HORN_STACK_H, z = -tibia_x)
    #   = (x in [81, 99], y in [-5, +1], z in [-130, 0]).  The tibia's
    #   knee pad disc (HIP_PAD_R = 19.5 radius about the knee axis,
    #   y in [-5, +1] in femur) also sweeps through this region at
    #   any non-trivial knee angle.
    #
    #   In the bridge-bottom region (x in [bridge_x_min, FEMUR_LENGTH],
    #   y in [bridge_y_min, +LINK_THICKNESS/2], z in [-23, -10]) the
    #   tibia spar at +90 deg collides over x in [81, 90], y in [-5, +1],
    #   z in [-23, -10], plus the pad disc adds a sliver at x in
    #   [73, 81] (where (x-90)^2 + z^2 <= 19.5^2 brushes the bridge
    #   top edge).  The existing knee_clear cylinder (Phi 45, y in
    #   [-1.5, +7.5]) only clears the top 2.5 mm of the tibia's y
    #   range; it does NOT reach the y in [-5, -1.5] slab where the
    #   tibia spar/pad-bottom intrude into the bridge.
    #
    # Fix: an axis-aligned box subtract covering the collision envelope
    # at x in [73, 91], y in [-5.5, +1.5], z in [-23.5, -9.5] (0.5 mm
    # margin on every face).  At +90 deg this clears the spar's bottom
    # flange tie + the +Y outboard half of the bottom bridge over the
    # outer 18 mm of the bridge's x range; the inboard 21 mm at x in
    # [bridge_x_min, 73] = [52, 73] is UNTOUCHED and still bonds the
    # spar's bottom flange (y in [0, +6], z in [-17, -11]) to the
    # well's bottom wall (y around -22 to -45, z in [-14.5, -10.7])
    # via the bridge's full y-extent.  The surviving inboard strut
    # cross-section is 21 mm x 11 mm x ~27 mm y-extent -- well above
    # any check_thin_sheets / check_flimsy_joints threshold and the
    # dominant load path was always the inboard half anyway (the
    # outboard half overhangs INTO the tibia's swing envelope).
    #
    # Top bridge symmetric cut: the MuJoCo knee range is asymmetric at
    # [-20, +80] deg, but probing both extremes shows the tibia pad
    # disc + spar bottom edge intrudes into the TOP bridge at the
    # -20 deg negative joint limit by the same y-slab mechanism (the
    # tibia y in [-5, -1.5] slab below knee_clear).  Cutting the top
    # bridge with the mirrored box at z in [+9.5, +23.5] clears both
    # extreme poses at once -- no downside since the outboard half
    # of the top bridge plays the same overhang role as the bottom
    # half and the inboard 21 mm still ties the spar's top flange to
    # the well's top wall.
    #
    # Safety re. the well cavity: the well's outer envelope sits at
    # femur y in [-49, -21.75] (probed) -- completely below the cut's
    # y in [-8.0, +3.0] band -- so neither cut box overlaps the well
    # body, the servo cavity, or the well's top/bottom wall.  The
    # bridges are the ONLY femur material in y in [-8.0, +3.0] x
    # x in [72, 91] x z in +/-[9.5, 23.5], so the cuts touch nothing
    # else.

    # Horn drop / spline-screw-back clearance (May 25 2026, user
    # correction following the wrong-axis 4cf3355 X-trim revert):
    # TIBIA_CLEAR_Y_MIN was -HORN_STACK_H - 0.5 = -5.5, i.e., only
    # 0.5 mm of vertical slack below the disc horn's NOMINAL bottom face
    # at y = -HORN_STACK_H = -5.  User: "the important thing is to
    # cut the Y down, not the X, lower the Y ... the point of this is
    # to make room for the x horn if it sits lower on the servo than
    # you think or if the screws go through the horn a bit, then when
    # it rotates it could get caught".  The knee disc horn rotates about
    # the spline axis at (FEMUR_LENGTH, *, 0); the BACK of the horn
    # (where the spline screws protrude) sweeps into the femur
    # material at y < -HORN_STACK_H.  (The clearance band is sized to
    # the larger now-retired plastic X-horn's Phi 36 mm sweep as a
    # conservative envelope.)  If the horn sits ~3 mm lower on
    # the spline than nominal (FEMUR_HIP_HUB_RECESS_DEPTH = 4 mm
    # already accounts for the same uncertainty on the hip side) or
    # the screws back out a couple mm, the swept disc punches into
    # the bridge cap at y < -5.5.  Lowering TIBIA_CLEAR_Y_MIN from

    Local frame (May 2026 collinear-pad refactor):
        Origin: knee pad mating face (= the knee disc-horn-top plane
                that the tibia bolts down onto).  The knee joint axis
                (= servo output spline tip) lives at link y =
                -HORN_STACK_H = -5 mm, HORN_STACK_H mm BELOW the
                local origin along link -Y.  Pre-refactor the origin
                used to be the knee joint axis with the pad raised
                to y = +HORN_STACK_H, which made the link an L-shape
                in side view (pad above spar by 8 mm).  The new
                convention puts pad + spar in the SAME y range
                (y in [0, +LINK_THICKNESS] = [0, +6]).
        +X = spar long-axis (foot socket at x = TIBIA_LENGTH)
        +Y = knee joint axis direction; points AWAY from the disc horn
             into the link body.  Pad and spar both span y in
             [0, +LINK_THICKNESS] = [0, +6] -- no L-bend in side
             view.  The single-tang foot end is in-plane with the
             spar (also at y in [0, +6]); the only sub-y=0 feature
             is the disc-horn envelope BELOW the pad which is cleared
             by construction (no link material below y = 0).
        +Z = perpendicular to spar, in the leg's plane of motion

    Knee end: a square pad centred on the joint axis (x=0, z=0) with
    the 4 horn bolt holes drilled in Y.  Bolt-circle CENTRE is on
    the joint axis so the tibia rotates rigidly with the horn.  A
    Phi HORN_CENTRE_OD = 3.4 mm (M3 clearance) hole is drilled
    through the pad's centre along +Y so the knee servo's central
    spline screw is reachable from above with the tibia already
    bolted to the disc horn -- mirrors the hip pad's central hole and
    the coxa_link pedestal cap centre hole (user-flagged May 2026).
    Foot end: a single TANG (a LINK_THICKNESS-wide downward tongue,
    centred on tibia y=0) that slides into the foot pad's clevis
    fork (see ``make_foot_pad``).  The tang carries an M3 through-
    hole at z = FOOT_HINGE_TIBIA_Z, parallel to the knee axis.

    May 2026 supports-free refactor: the tibia is now LINK_THICKNESS
    = 6 mm wide in tibia Y EVERYWHERE (spar + tang) so the entire
    part prints as a flat 6-mm-tall slab when oriented with the
    spar's broad face on the bed.  Pre-2026 the tibia ended in a
    12-mm-wide CLEVIS (2 cheeks + 4 mm tongue slot) that protruded
    6 mm above the spar's broad face in that orientation and forced
    supports under the cheeks.  Inverting the hinge so the FOOT
    carries the fork and the TIBIA carries a single tang removed
    the protrusion; the hinge axis, pin, nut and rotational
    kinematics are otherwise identical to the old design.

    wall, so no socket geometry exists here at all.  NOT an emitted printed

    cradle / clamp-cap checks).

    knee anyway -- the empty holes + counterbores just punched through the
    spar-to-wall junction.  The knee servo is retained by the clamp cap +
    retaining lip (the hip cradle on coxa_link keeps its 4 bolts).

    ``farwall_pad=True`` (Aug 2026): external buttress pad on the far

    FEMUR_KNEE_FARWALL_PAD_* constants block.

    back face -- 2x M2.5 self-tappers into the servo's rear molded hole
    pair nearer the spar/yoke end (the connector-end pair stays open for
    the bus harness); see the FEMUR_REAR_TAB_* constants block.

    ``wire_exit=False`` (Aug 2026, user: "this top can just be a flat wall
    with no weird cutouts"): no DS3225-era wire corridor at the knee -- the
