"""VARIANT: rigid-hip yaw axis -- a THIRD 6805 bearing above each hip,
carried by an extended hip clamp cap, seated in a full-size top chassis.

Concept (user, Aug 2026): the production yaw joint carries the coxa on a
6805-2RS pair in chassis_bottom's tower, but the hip servo above it is
still a cantilever -- leg loads twist the coxa link about the bearing
pair.  This variant closes the loop from the TOP:

  * ``hip_clamp_cap_rigid`` -- the stock ``make_servo_clamp_cap()`` (the
    hip clamshell lid) grown UP along the yaw axis: a Phi 29 pedestal
    (inner-race seat shoulder, same role as the yaw hub's uflange) and a
    Phi 25.15 press boss (= ``YAW_HUB_BOSS_OD``, the bench-tuned +0.15
    interference the lower hub boss already uses) that a third 6805-2RS
    presses onto.  Knee caps stay stock.
  * ``chassis_top_rigid`` -- a SECOND 200 mm flat-to-flat hex plate
    (same footprint/thickness as chassis_bottom's sheet) whose six
    Phi 44 bosses pocket the bearings' outer races at Phi 37.15
    (= ``YAW_TOWER_BORE_OD``, the bench-tuned firm finger-press fit),
    race retained by the Phi 34 shoulder (= ``YAW_TOWER_SHOULDER_OD``).
    Six Phi 7 DRIVER ACCESS holes sit above the inboard cap bolts (legs
    at yaw 0): the cap is a CAPTIVE BEARING CARRIER -- its 6805 is
    pressed on once and never removed; all service unbolts the cap from
    the coxa cradle (both bolts reachable with the plate on) and lifts
    the plate + caps + bearings off as one rigid unit.
  * ``corner_pillar`` (x6) -- plain solid elliptical printed columns
    at the six corner azimuths (rho 81.6, between adjacent rings);
    >= 5 mm leg clearance at every yaw angle is guaranteed by the
    rotating parts' ROT_ENVELOPE_R trim (see ``coxa_link_rigid``),
    not by shaping the column.  They tie the top
    frame to chassis_bottom at the RIM, where each hip moment's force
    couple actually wants to react (push at the bottom tower, pull at
    the top ring) and where torsional leverage is ~4x the old standoff
    radius.  Each pillar doubles as the lid-screw boss: the hatch
    perimeter screw threads into the pillar top through the frame; one
    dedicated frame screw per pillar keeps the frame clamped with the
    lid off; two M3 through-bolts with belly nylocs hold each foot
    through printed holes in ``chassis_bottom_rigid`` (on a STOCK
    chassis print: drill them using the foot as the jig).  The four
    central 90 mm standoffs remain only as hatch/electronics anchors.
  * ``coxa_link_rigid`` (x6) -- the production coxa with four variant
    edits: the vertical hub column SHORTENED by COL_DROP (the Phi 52.4
    platform disc, dust-lip skirt and uflange -- all sized around the
    deleted production cap -- are removed, the horn screws swap
    M3x30 -> M3x20 (same thread engagement, seats 10 mm deeper), and
    the slab + cradle unit drops so the well floor sits just over the
    screw heads; see the COXA SHORTEN constants), servo-cradle corners
    rounded to the 38.2 mm yaw envelope (max 2.16 mm off two vertical
    wall corners), the hub's existing Phi 25.15 boss pressing the
    relocated bottom race 0.5 mm over the deck (user, Aug 25: "why
    cant the bearing come down even more and be right on top of the
    servo?" -- see BEARING COUNT), and a small Phi 38 DUST BRIM
    hovering 0.5 above the race-top / tower-rim plane -- non-contact,
    stepped 3 mm INSIDE the tower Phi 44 so the coxa reads as coxa,
    not as more chassis column (see the BRIM_* constants).  Horn
    interface, cradle pilots and cap seat untouched.
  * ``chassis_bottom_rigid`` (x1) -- the production chassis with the
    six tower platforms trimmed to the tower's own Phi 44 cylinder
    (user, Aug 24: corners rounded; rev 2: all corner curves must
    match -- so the tower curve is now the ONLY curve), each tower
    band REBUILT LOW so the single bearing sits on a deck-level seat
    ledge and is FULLY housed (full 7 mm outer-race wrap; the Phi 44
    column ends exactly at the bearing top, now world 17.75 -- user,
    Aug 25: bearing right on top of the servo, race bottom 0.5 mm
    over the case), the dead cap-bolt ear lugs shaved (outboard +
    tangential + the inboard one, whose below-deck root now goes with
    the rev-6 shell flatten), the 18 pillar-foot
    holes printed in, the six corner Wago TRAY WALL SETS DELETED
    (user, Aug 24 -- the splices live in centre_wago_block now, so
    the trays are dead geometry), and the wago-era WIRE-CORRIDOR
    APPARATUS plus the whole CRADLE-SHELL run outboard of it (side
    walls + deck-skin roof, the "two gray things" that flanked each
    corner pillar) FLATTENED to the sheet up to the tower keep
    cylinder (user, Aug 24 rev 5 -- "that CRADLE WALL isnt doing
    shit, just flatten it out" -- and Aug 25 rev 6; see the
    CHB_FLAT_* constants).  See the CHB_* constant block.  Every
    remaining functional surface (pocket, seat, well collar, slots)
    is production geometry.
  * ``centre_wago_block`` -- the corner Wagos are gone (pillars stand
    there), so the power tree consolidates: 4x 5-port 221-415 (two per
    net, jumpered) in one printed press-fit block at the chassis
    centre, under the open hatch, replacing the 6 corner + 2 trunk
    nuts.

  Load path: hip moment -> cap boss -> top bearing -> top plate ->
  six rim pillars -> chassis_bottom / five other legs.  Each yaw axis
  becomes simply-supported (one bearing below, one above, ~65 mm
  mid-plane to mid-plane) instead of cantilevered.

  BEARING COUNT (user, Aug 24: "we really only need one bearing on
  the bottom -- simplify"): ONE bottom bearing per leg, seated
  directly in chassis_bottom's own open-top Phi 37.15 pocket (the
  production LOWER-race position: drop-in path and z=0.5 seat are
  print-proven).  The bolt-on ``yaw_bearing_cap`` is DELETED -- it
  only existed to house the second race and retain the pair, and the
  top plate now does both jobs: standing loads go UP through the top
  bearing into the plate shoulder, hanging loads go DOWN through the
  hub's new Phi 29 seat ring -> inner race -> outer race -> tower
  seat.  -6 printed caps, -18 M3x8 cap screws, and the leg + bearing
  lift straight out once the plate is off (horn centre screw only).
  The tower rim is RAISED to the race-top plane (full 7 mm wrap), so
  nothing stands proud and the coxa sits directly on the bearing
  (user, Aug 24 -- see the TOWER RIM / BRIM constants).  Net bearings
  per robot: 12, same as production.

TRADE-OFF (measured by the sweep in this script): the full-size top
plate caps the femur's UP-swing.  The production workspace envelope is
femur in [-80, +30] deg; the plate + its bearing bosses cut the up
limit to roughly -55 deg (exact per-yaw contact angles printed at
build time and baked into the scene's joint limits).  Walking gaits
around STANCE_FEMUR_DEG = -25 are unaffected; deep leg tucks (e.g.
stand-up curls) must be re-checked against the new envelope before
this variant goes on the robot.

NOT a production change: nothing in the verified parts registry moves.

# ROUNDED-CORNER ENVELOPE (user, Aug 24: "round the corners of the

# the column is a plain solid ellipse.  Axis-to-column-surface is
# 43.24 mm (measured: 43.24 - 40.36 gave the old 2.88 graze), so a
# <= 38.2 mm rotating envelope guarantees >= 5 mm clearance at EVERY

#   * coxa_link_rigid -- the production coxa's servo-cradle corners
#     reached 40.36 mm; they are rounded back to the envelope arc
#     (max 2.16 mm off two vertical wall corners, 8 vertices; the

#     in this variant (6 reprints) -- the price of the plain column.

# BOTTOM JOINT (user, Aug 24: "we really only need one bearing on the
# bottom -- so maybe its possible to simplify the design"; Aug 25:
# "why cant the bearing come down even more and be right on top of
# the servo?").  The variant first moved the single race into the
# production LOWER-race pocket (coxa-local z 0.5) and DELETED the
# bolt-on yaw_bearing_cap (-6 prints, -18 screws).  The Aug 25 rev
# drops the race a further BR_DROP = 5 to the true physical floor:
# race bottom RACE_DECK_CL = 0.5 above the servo-mount deck-top
# plane (world 10.25), which is simultaneously the yaw servo's
# case-top plane and the plane where the hub's Phi 25.15 press boss
# necks to its Phi 20 drive nub.  Race band: coxa-local -4.5..+2.5,
# world 10.75..17.75.
# WHY IT CAN SIT THIS LOW (corrects the old "race cannot sit lower,
# it would rub the horn" claim -- that was ARCHITECTURAL, not
# physical): the disc horn is not at the z=0 mount plane at all.
# The real Phi 20 disc sits RECESSED in the servo's output face at
# coxa-local -11..-9 (world 4.25..6.25, under the deck plate), and
# everything between the deck plane and the old race position is
# the coxa hub's OWN Phi 25.15 wide boss -- which production already
# runs down to the deck plane (hp.YAW_HUB_BOSS_WIDE_BOT_Z = -5),
# necking to the Phi 20 nub that reaches the horn through the
# deck's Phi 24 bore.  The horn and its screw heads (which seat
# HIGH in the slab, never down here) are inside/below that boss, so
# the inner race presses on the SAME bench-tuned +0.15 boss band as
# before, just 5 mm lower on the same cylinder.  NO new collar, no
# new press geometry: the "collar" IS the production boss.  The
# floor is set by the static deck/case-top plane at world 10.25
# (the outer race and its printed ledge must clear the servo case
# by RACE_DECK_CL) -- to go lower the servo itself would have to
# sink into the chassis.
# The hub's Phi 29 seat ring (production uflange OD, bears only on
# the Phi 25..29 inner-race land) follows the race top down to
# coxa-local 2.5.  Axial: hanging legs load hub -> ring -> inner
# race -> outer race -> tower LEDGE at world 10.75; standing loads
# go up through the TOP bearing into the plate shoulder -- each
# bearing takes one direction, no cap lip needed.
# TOWER LEDGE + RIM: the chassis tower's Phi 34 shoulder relief
# (production band world 10.25..15.75) is bored out to the
# Phi 37.15 press bore down to world 10.75, leaving a 0.5 mm-proud
# Phi 34/Phi 37.15 step -- the new outer-race seat ledge (face
# r 17.0..18.575, same 1.5 mm race land as the production seat) --
# sitting directly on the 4 mm servo-mount deck, solid at every
# azimuth (probed: the well breach lives below world ~8.5).  The
# tower above is trimmed so the Phi 44 column ends exactly at the
# new race-top plane (world 17.75, full 7 mm wrap, hoop wall
# 3.425 mm -- identical section to the production pocket band).
# The old raised-rim rings are gone; the rim IS the trimmed tower.
# What remains above is the small Phi 38 DUST BRIM on the coxa,
# hovering 0.5 above the rim / race-top plane and stepped 3 mm
# inside the tower OD, so the visual stack is deck -> bearing (in
# the tower) -> coxa.  Grit still has one turn (under the brim,
# through the 0.5 axial gap) to reach the 2RS seal -- the seal is
# the real barrier, and the brim still roofs the seal + outer-race
# band completely.  Non-contact everywhere: brim-to-rim and
# brim-to-race gaps are both BRIM_GAP, the rotating seat ring keeps
# 4.0 mm radial to the pocket bore, and the rotating inner race /
# boss keep RACE_DECK_CL axial to the deck and 4.4 mm radial to the
# ledge lip.  The az-210 cap-bolt ear root is below the deck
# (z 10.25 world), under the ledge band, untouched.
#
# COXA SHORTEN (user, Aug 24 rev 3: "from around 25mm to 40mm above
# the platform top seems largely unnecessary.  You need to redesign
# the coxa link to make it shorter, theres a bunch of unneccessary
# stuff there").  Audit of that band (coxa-local z ~10..25) found the
# production coxa's vertical hub column was sized around apparatus
# this variant DELETED:
#   * the Phi 52.4 dust-lip SKIRT (z 14..18) labyrinthed over the
#     production cap ring -- the cap is gone and the variant has its
#     own Phi 38 brim at z 3..5, so the skirt hung in mid-air;
#   * the Phi 52.4 platform DISC (z 18..24) existed to clear the
#     production cap rim at z 16.5 by YAW_HUB_CAP_AXIAL_CL and to
#     hang that skirt -- with the cap deleted and the bearing down at
#     z -4.5..+2.5, that clearance stack is filler;
#   * the production uflange (z 14.5..16.5) retained the deleted
#     UPPER race -- the variant's seat ring at the relocated race
#     already does its job.
# What is NOT filler is the horn-screw stack: production bench-pinned
# the M3x30 head seats at YAW_HUB_HORN_HEAD_SEAT_Z = +17.75 (screw
# length + measured print shortfall + tip poke -- the tips cannot go
# deeper without jamming the disc off its seat, see the constants in
# hexapod_prototype).  The redesign drops the whole slab + cradle
# unit (a rigid body: cradle pilots, cap seat, 688 housing, rear tab
# all ride along) by COL_DROP so the well floor lands COL_HEAD_CL
# above the screw heads, deletes the skirt + disc outright, and
# truncates the hub boss at the dropped slab.  The hip axis and
# EVERYTHING keyed to it (cap boss, top bearing, top plate, pillars,
# hatch, standoffs) drop by the same COL_DROP -- shorter pillars,
# shorter robot, same simply-supported stack.
#
# HORN SCREWS SHORTENED M3x30 -> M3x20 (user, Aug 25: "worry about
# the screws last -- I can buy any type of screw and shorter ones
# would be better, so the shorter we can make this the better").
# The Aug 24 rev-4 step went M3x30 -> M3x25 because the tower rim
# (then at the race top, world 22.75) capped how far the rotating
# slab could drop.  With the BEARING itself dropped onto the deck
# (see the BOTTOM JOINT block: race now at world 10.75..17.75, rim
# at 17.75), the rim moved down 5 mm and the slab can follow: all 5
# horn screws per hub (4 drive + 1 centre; 30 per robot --
# PURCHASED-HARDWARE CHANGE) become M3x20, and every seat plane
# drops by EXACTLY the 10 mm length delta vs production.  Seat -
# length = tip, so the tip planes and the thread engagement are
# IDENTICAL to the bench-tuned production stack: corner tips still
# break the disc horn's far face by TIP_POKE (full 2 mm tapped-disc
# engagement), the centre screw still reaches the same depth in the
# output spline's tapped bore.  check_coxa_column asserts the seat
# drop == the length delta.
# Why not M3x16: another -4 would put SLAB_BOT_Z at 0.0 (world
# 15.25), i.e. the rotating cradle slab 2.5 mm BELOW the static
# tower rim (17.75) -- collision.  M3x20 is the shortest standard
# length that fits this joint; it lands the slab 1.5 mm over the
# rim (>= 0.5 required), the same margin the M3x25 revision had.

# CHASSIS VARIANT (user, Aug 24: "round the corners on the chassis
# bottom below where the bearings go"; rev 2 same day: "I don't like
# the multiple curves here, they should all match").  Each production
# yaw tower stands on a SQUARE outboard platform (leg-frame face
# x 121.2; half-width 21.25 above the sheet, 18.9 for the z -6..-2
# belly skirt; top face z 6.25) whose corners poked 8.4 mm diagonally
# past the Phi 44 tower.  Rev 1 rounded them with a bolt-on R 10
# corner radius, which stacked THREE different arcs at each corner
# (platform R 10 arc, the shallower chord the same cylinder cut into
# the narrower skirt, and the r 22 tower crown right above) -- the
# user rejected the mismatch.  Now the corners are simply TRIMMED TO
# THE TOWER'S OWN CYLINDER (r 22.02 about the yaw axis; 0.02 proud so
# the boolean never grazes the tower's own tessellation).  In
# production the tower already bulges through the platform band (its
# r 22 circle crosses the +-21.25 side faces at x 100+-5.9), so the
# trim just continues that same curve around the end and down the
# skirt: every band shows ONE curve -- the tower's -- and the
# side-face junction is the crease production already has.  The
# bearing pocket, well walls and rim are untouched.  With the
# yaw_bearing_cap deleted, the three M3 cap-bolt ear lugs per tower
# (PCD 47, z 6.25..19.75) are dead weight:
#   * the OUTBOARD ear (coxa az 330) sat ON the trimmed corner --
#     shaved flush to the tower cylinder (0.05 bite into the tower
#     skin for clean topology);
#   * the TANGENTIAL ear (az 90) poked 6.8 mm past the platform
#     silhouette -- shaved flush to the rim-wall face (y 20.45);
#   * the INBOARD ear (az 210, r to 28 from the yaw axis) is shaved
#     flush to the SERVO-MOUNT DECK TOP (z 10.25): the free-standing
#     column above the deck (z 10.25..19.75, its M3 pilot served the
#     deleted cap) is cut away, while the below-deck root (6.25..
#     10.25) STAYS merged with the well-mouth collar -- cutting there
#     risks gouging the collar, and it invisibly stiffens the deck.
#     After this, NOTHING pokes past the tower cylinder above the
#     deck at any azimuth: the six towers read as clean bare columns.
# Since the chassis is a variant print now anyway, the 18 pillar-
# foot bolt holes are PRINTED IN (the foot-as-drill-jig bench mod

# literal in hexapod_prototype._chassis_yaw_cradle_solid), so the
# cradle-shell box survives out to r 23.5 across the mount-plate band
# (z CHB_PLATE_TOP..CHB_DECK_TOP).  After the ear + flatten cuts, two
# Phi 47 ring-sector arcs per leg remained on the outboard flank
# (leg-frame az ~17..55 and ~300..314, measured on the shipped STL,
# identical on all six legs) -- pure leftovers: the bearing seat,
# hoop wall and deck all live inside r 22, and the cap bolts that
# once justified r 23.5 are deleted in this variant.  A per-leg ring
# cutter (same footprint as the corner trim, z band padded 0.25 past
# the bump) shaves them to CHB_TRIM_R, so the tower outer profile is
# ONE vertical cylinder (r 22.00..22.02) from the sheet top to the

# each corner pillar at ~10 mm).  Rev 5 cut the wago-era WIRE-
# CORRIDOR apparatus (cradle end wall at x 61.5..64.5, porch canopy,
# inboard side-wall stubs) back to the bare sheet with a box ending
# at x 64.65.  Rev 6 extends that same box to the yaw axis and
# subtracts the tower KEEP cylinder (r CHB_KEEP_R about x 100), which
# removes the remaining cradle SHELL outboard of the old cut face:
# the 5.6 mm side walls at leg-frame |y| 13.2..18.8 (z 2 -> 10.25,
# standing 0.85 mm off the servo case flanks) and the 2.2 mm deck-
# skin roof they carried (z ~8.05 -> 10.25, spanning |y| <= 18.8,
# hovering 1.8 mm above the REAL case top at z 6.25 -- the seated
# servo's "case top = deck top 10.25" plane is only the horn-boss
# region inside the tower; the visual servo block is a fat envelope).

# registers nothing, and the walls' only job was holding the roof up.

# drop-out loads (plate pilots at leg-frame x 71/87.5, |y| 21,
# z -2..1 -- outside the cut in x, y AND z, verified), and the shell

def make_chassis_bottom_rigid() -> trimesh.Trimesh:
    """The production chassis_bottom with the CHB_* variant edits (see
    the constant block above):

      * PLATFORM CORNERS: everything outboard of the hex edge
        (leg-frame x > 100) between the belly (z -6.5) and the
        platform top (z 6.25) is trimmed to the tower's own cylinder
        (r 22.02 about the yaw axis).  The square platform and skirt
        corners disappear and the whole tower base reads as ONE
        cylinder from belly to bearing pocket -- no second corner
        radius anywhere.  The trim is 0.02 proud of the tower wall,
        so pocket/walls/rim keep production geometry.
      * LOWERED POCKET (Aug 25): the whole tower band above the new
        seat plane (world 10.75) is cut away (cylinder r 22.1, so
        the production Phi 34 shoulder relief, the old Phi 37.15
        pocket and the old seat all go) and rebuilt as ONE fresh
        Phi 44 / Phi 37.15 ring from the deck up to the race-top
        plane (world 17.75, unioned AFTER the cuts so the ear
        shaves never nick it, 1 mm fusion overlap into the deck
        band below the seat).  What remains of the Phi 34 relief is
        a 0.5 mm band over the deck whose top face IS the new
        outer-race seat ledge (r 17.0..18.575, sitting on the 4 mm
        deck at every azimuth); the single bearing is fully housed
        (full 7 mm outer-race wrap) and the chassis column ends
        exactly at the bearing top, 5 mm lower than before.
      * DEAD EARS: the outboard (az 330) cap-bolt ear is shaved flush
        to the tower cylinder, the tangential (az 90) ear flush to the
        rim-wall face, and the inboard (az 210) ear flush to the
        servo-mount deck top (z 10.25) -- its below-deck root, which
        used to stay merged with the roof skin, now goes with the
        rev-6 shell flatten (the ear centre is outside the tower keep
        cylinder).  Above the deck, nothing pokes past the tower
        cylinder at any azimuth.
      * TOWER FLANK SMOOTHED (user, Aug 25 rev 7): the production
        +X swing relief spares a protect cylinder 1.5 mm FATTER than
        the tower (r 23.5), which left two Phi 47 ring-sector arcs
        per leg bulging off the outboard flank across the mount-plate
        band (z 6.25..10.25) -- the "weird bump".  They carry nothing
        (see the rev-7 constant-block note), so a ring cutter shaves
        them to the same CHB_TRIM_R cylinder as the corner trim: the
        tower outer surface now reads as ONE vertical cylinder from
        the sheet top to the rim.
      * FOOT HOLES: the 18 Phi 3.4 pillar-foot bolt holes are printed
        through the sheet (same PILLAR_* constants as the feet, so
        they line up by construction).
      * WAGO TRAYS DELETED (user, Aug 24): the corner power splices
        moved into centre_wago_block, so the six integrated tray wall
        sets are dead geometry -- every wall above the sheet top is
        cut away (the 1 mm embed band below the top face is interior
        material and stays).  The pillar feet register on their three
        M3 bolts instead of the old wall key.
      * WIRE CORRIDOR + CRADLE SHELL FLATTENED (user, Aug 24 rev 5 +
        Aug 25 rev 6): one box per leg (leg-frame x CHB_FLAT_X0..X1,
        |y| <= CHB_FLAT_HALF_Y, sheet top to over the deck) MINUS the
        tower keep cylinder cuts the wago-era corridor apparatus AND
        the remaining cradle-shell run (side walls + the deck-skin
        roof they carried -- the "two gray things" flanking each
        pillar) back to the bare sheet.  See the CHB_FLAT_* constant
        block for the measurements showing nothing needs them.  The
        servo stays registered by the sheet-level well, the belly
        retainer and the shell inside the keep cylinder (which also
        carries the 6805 seat's inboard arc); the retainer pilots
        live below the sheet top, untouched.
