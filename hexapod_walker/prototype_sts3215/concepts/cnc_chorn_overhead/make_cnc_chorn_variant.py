"""VARIANT: CNC aluminum C-clamps sized for LEGS-OVER-HEAD femur travel.

Concept (user, Aug 2026): "make a version of this [the rigid-hip
variant] with metal CNCed C clamps -- a little bigger so this hexapod
can put its legs over its head".

WHAT THE C-CLAMP IS (repo evidence: cad_step_test/build_chorn_step.py,
docs/CHORN_VARIANT.md, tools/make_chorn_variant.py): the C-shaped
bracket at each pitch joint (hip + knee) that clamps the servo's driven
20 mm disc horn on one side and the stock passive disc on the rear
idler boss on the other -- the part that replaces the PRINTED moving
clevis/yoke halves of the production femur and tibia.  The earlier
"C-horn variant" experiment assumed a BOUGHT stock aluminum C horn plus
printed adapters and loose spacers; THIS variant designs the part
proper, as a CNC-machined 6061-T6 bracket with integral standoff
bosses, sized so the femur can swing past vertical.

WHY OVERHEAD WORKS: THE OUTBOARD HIP PIVOT (user course-correction,
Aug 2026: "the coxa link is redesigned to position the hip servo
further out from the hexapod's body").  The production/rigid coxa put
the hip axis a mere 12.5 mm outboard of the yaw axis, i.e. right at
the top plate's rim: any femur-frame material with swing radius above
~40 mm crossed plate structure on the way up (the rigid-hip -47.5
limit, and the reason a previous rev of THIS concept grew a swan-neck
blade + notch + cap shave carved out of a contact map -- superseded,
overcomplicated).  This rev moves the hip pivot COXA_EXT = 42 mm
further outboard by extending the variant coxa's cradle arm, so the
up-swinging femur simply clears the rim because the pivot sits beyond
it, and the C-clamp reverts to a PLAIN C (rectangular blades, full
web, zero contact-map features).

Sweep-derived sizing (see the COXA_EXT block): the plain clamp needs
ext >= 42 for its first plate contact (low corners vs the yaw-tower
collar) to recede past -117.5; the KNEE-end parts saturate at first
contact -117.5 at ANY offset (the plate's Phi 44 dust-roof collar over
the yaw bearing always sits under the knee-end's inboard dip window --
the physics ceiling), which is why the single planar WEDGE chamfer on
the printed knee block + cap is the one overhead feature kept from the
previous rev.  Swept result: first contact -117.5 -> baked limit -110
deg (>= 5 deg true margin), vs -47.5 on rigid_hip and -80 in the
production workspace.

PARTS (this concept's step/ + stl/, BuildViz cnc_chorn_overhead):

  * ``chorn_clamp_cnc``  (12x, CNC 6061-T6, NOT printed) -- the PLAIN
    C-clamp: two 3 mm rectangular blades (y -20..+13) with integral
    Phi 19 ring bosses (4.5 mm below, 4.0 mm above -- replaces the
    chorn experiment's 8 loose spacers per joint), R13 rounded end
    over the disc, and a full-height 3.8 mm web whose outer face is
    the joint's mounting plane, with 4 TAPPED M3 holes (threads in
    metal -- no printed threads, no inserts in the load path).  R2.5
    internal corner gussets + R3 plan fillets are modeled (>= 2 mm
    tool radius everywhere).
  * ``coxa_link_ovh``    (6x, PETG) -- the rigid-hip coxa with its
    cradle arm (hip bracket + foot slab) moved COXA_EXT = 42 mm
    outboard; every yaw-axis interface (horn drive, hub boss, seat
    ring, dust brim) is untouched, byte-compared in check_coxa_ovh.
    The 38.2 mm rotation-envelope trim only applies inboard (the arm
    intentionally exceeds it; see check_yaw_envelope_ovh for the
    replacement guarantees).
  * ``femur_ovh_body``   (6x, PETG) -- the production knee block
    (cradle + 688 housing + far-wall pad, via
    step._femur_knee_fixed_solid) with: the overhead WEDGE chamfer on
    its inboard-top corner, 4 screw cbores for the web joint, the
    knee-cap up-screw bore, and the pocket for the variant cap's
    insert boss.  The yoke arms + spine of the production femur are
    GONE -- the metal clamp is the femur's hip half.
  * ``tibia_ovh_socket`` (6x, PETG) -- flange + CF-tube socket that
    bolts to the tibia-side clamp web the same way (8 mm flange, tube
    mouth pulled 10.6 mm outboard; the tube gets ~16.6 mm shorter and
    almost touches the metal web -- stiffer, lighter).
  * ``knee_clamp_cap_ovh`` (6x, PETG) -- production servo clamp cap
    minus the overhead wedge tail and minus its inboard side-screw
    boss (which died with the tail); retention is redesigned as an
    M3x25 UP-SCREW from the cradle underside into a Phi 4 x 6 heat-set
    insert in a hang-boss, bridged to the surviving tongue rib by a
    riser + a strap over the servo top (see the CAP_* constant block).
    Horn hooks, back hook, outboard screw and the tongue rib's
    outboard run are untouched.  (The previous rev also shaved the
    crown tail; the outboard pivot made that shave unnecessary.)

UNCHANGED: the rigid_hip chassis plates, hatch, hip cap and wago block,
every bearing/servo/COTS item, robot height and the whole vertical
stack.  MOVED: the hip axis (and with it the whole leg beyond it) sits
COXA_EXT further out radially -- stance footprint grows by 2 x 42 mm
across flats and the yaw joint carries more moment (quantified in
report_outboard_geometry + the README).  This driver re-runs
rigid_hip's ENTIRE check suite on the shared parts, then adds the
variant coxa / clamp / joint checks and the overhead sweep.

PRESS-FIT / TOLERANCE WARNING (PETG -> 6061): every bench-tuned
interference in this stack was tuned on printed PETG.  The clamp's
disc-pad span is therefore NOT carried over as an interference: the
production yoke squeezed the discs by 2 x YOKE_SEAT_INTERF = 0.26 mm
(plastic compliance); a rigid aluminum C at that squeeze would bend the
blades, not seat.  The CNC part is dimensioned to the NOMINAL disc span
38.04 mm at +0.00/+0.05, preload comes from the disc screws.  Flagged
as needs-bench-tuning in design_spec.yaml -- do not "fix" it back.

STEP-FIRST PIPELINE: geometry is authored as build123d/OpenCascade BREP
in build_cnc_chorn_step.py (STEP files are the CNC quoting deliverable);
this driver runs that exporter, loads the tessellations, assembles,
checks, sweeps and writes the BuildViz scene.

Run:  uv run python concepts/cnc_chorn_overhead/make_cnc_chorn_variant.py
      (--skip-sweep for fast geometry iterations;
       --skip-brep to reuse existing step/stl/ exports)

# --- OUTBOARD HIP PIVOT (the legs-over-head architecture) -----------------
# The variant coxa extends its cradle arm so the hip servo sits COXA_EXT
# further out along the leg (+x in the coxa frame).  Sweep-derived, in
# two passes.  Plan-raster probe (_probe_outboard.py, blade footprint +
# sampled knee-side parts): ext 28 -> blade first plate contact -107.5,
# ext 32 -> -112.5, ext 36 -> blade clear thru -120.  The REAL clamp
# solid (pad bosses + full-height web, swept as meshes on the built
# geometry) needs more: its low corners meet the yaw-tower collar
# (r ~21 from the yaw axis, i.e. a yaw-INVARIANT contact) at -110 for
# ext 36, -117.5 for ext 41, and clear past -117.5 from ext 42 up.
# The KNEE-end parts saturate at first contact -117.5 no matter the
# offset: past ~-102 the knee end dips below the plate-top plane on the
# INBOARD side 31..51 mm from the hip axis, and the plate's Phi 44
# dust-roof collar over the yaw bearing sits in that window for ANY
# offset up to ~+60 (it recedes at the same rate the dip window grows).
# That is the physics ceiling: the single WEDGE chamfer on the printed
# knee block + cap (kept from the previous rev, one plane) holds the
# knee-end swing radius under the collar, and no offset removes the
# need for it.  COXA_EXT = 42 is the minimum at which the saturating
# knee end -- not the clamp -- is the limiter; more offset buys
# nothing but yaw-joint moment.  Expected sweep: first contact -117.5
# (knee block/cap vs collar) => safe up-limit -110.
