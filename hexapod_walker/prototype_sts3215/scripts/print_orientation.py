"""Canonical print poses for every printed part.

PART_REGISTRY maps each printable STL to its builder in
`hexapod_prototype.py` and the re-orientation that puts it in its print
pose (broad flat face on the build plate, hollow pockets opening toward
+Z, z_min = 0 so the part rests on the bed).

This is the single source of truth for print orientation:

  * the verifier's flat-bottom printability guard (`check_flat_bottom`
    in `_verify_prototype.py`) sweeps the registry and fails any part
    whose print pose leaves a support-needing overhang;
  * `scripts/_flatbottom_check.py` uses it for the standalone audit;
  * `design_spec.yaml`'s `print_orientations` section mirrors the
    `_reorient_*` rotations for documentation.

(History: this module started as `prepare_xometry_upload.py`, which also
wrote an upload bundle for ordering prints from Xometry.  The bundle
generation was removed in Aug 2026 — parts are printed at home from
`stl_prototype/` — but the print-pose registry stayed load-bearing.)
