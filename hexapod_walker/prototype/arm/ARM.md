# Optional 5-DOF Arm Add-On

This is an **optional** anthropomorphic arm + parallel-jaw gripper that
bolts on top of the hexapod's chassis using the 4 centre M3 holes that
otherwise hold the electronics tray.

The arm now lives at `prototype/arm/` (was `hexapod_walker/arm/`) so it
ships next to the prototype it bolts onto.  It is **off by default**:

* `./run.sh hexapod_walker/prototype/build_all.py` -- builds the
  hexapod prototype as before, ignores this directory.
* `./run.sh hexapod_walker/prototype/build_all.py --with-arm` --
  additionally regenerates `prototype/arm/stl_arm/`, the arm Bambu
  plates, and an arm-inclusive assembly preview.
* `./run.sh hexapod_walker/prototype/_verify_prototype.py --with-arm`
  -- additionally runs the arm-vs-chassis / arm-vs-leg interference
  check (`[4b]`) and the flimsy-joint check on the 5 new arm parts
  (`[6b]`).

The arm is otherwise fully self-contained: nothing in `prototype/`
imports anything from this directory unless the `--with-arm` flag is
set, so a hexapod build with no arm pays nothing for these files.

The arm re-uses the leg's parametric geometry (DS3225 servo well,
24 mm horn PCD, 49.5 × 10 mm tab pattern) so a single bag of M3
hardware works for the entire robot.  Only **5 genuinely new printable
parts** are introduced; the J2 / J3 / J4 kinematic chain is built out
of three re-exported leg parts.

## Joint table

| Joint | Role            | Servo            | Axis     | Travel    | Cradle      |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| J1    | base yaw        | DS3225 25 kg·cm  | +Z       | ±90°      | `arm_base_bracket`   |
| J2    | shoulder pitch  | DS3225 25 kg·cm  | +Y       | -90°..+90°| `arm_shoulder_link` (= leg coxa_link) |
| J3    | elbow pitch     | DS3225 25 kg·cm  | +Y       | -10°..+120° | `arm_upper` (= leg femur_link) |
| J4    | wrist pitch     | DS3225 25 kg·cm  | +Y       | -90°..+90°| `gripper_base` (J4 cradle inside) |
| J5    | gripper         | Tower Pro MG90S  | +Y       | -45°..+45°| `gripper_base` (J5 cradle inside) |

All four pitch axes (J2, J3, J4) stay parallel — the arm is a planar
chain rotated about a single base yaw (J1).  Reach is straight-out
**220 mm** from the J1 axis to the wrist root (= `FEMUR_LENGTH` +
`TIBIA_LENGTH` = 90 + 130 mm), and another ~ 90 mm from the wrist
root to the gripper tip in a fully-extended wrist pose.  In the neutral
"ready to pick" pose (J2 = -25°, J3 = +60°, J4 = +25°) the gripper tip
sits at roughly **(+129, 0, +5) mm** from the J1 axis — just past the
chassis edge, at the chassis-top elevation.

## Bolt-on instructions

1. **Remove the electronics tray** (the flat PLA plate that lives in
   the centre of the chassis top, bolted to the 4 centre M3 holes on
   the 35 mm radius).  Re-mount it elsewhere (e.g. underneath the
   chassis bottom plate, or to one of the empty side-edge regions) or
   leave it for later if you're feeling brave with wire-routing.
2. **Bolt `arm_base_bracket.stl` onto the chassis top.**  Use 4 M3 x
   16 mm cap screws + nylock nuts from underneath, through the same
   35-mm radius 4-hole pattern that the electronics tray used.  No
   chassis modification or extra cutouts are required: the J1 servo
   well sits entirely **above** the chassis top plate.
3. **Drop the J1 DS3225 servo into the base bracket's well from
   above** until its mounting tabs land on the well rim, then drive
   4 servo self-tappers down through the tabs into the bracket pilot
   holes.  Route the servo's 3-wire harness out of the L-shaped wire
   exit slot at the -Y / -Z corner of the well.
4. **Stack the J1 horn, the printed `servo_horn_adapter.stl`, and
   `arm_shoulder_link.stl`** on top of the J1 spline using a single
   M3 x 25-30 mm centre screw plus 4 M3 x 8 mm bolts on the horn-
   adapter's 20.8 mm PCD (4 holes at 0/90/180/270 deg, aligned with the
   plastic horn's X arms).  The shoulder link is a literal re-export of
   the leg's `coxa_link` — its hub matches the standard servo horn
   adapter and its outboard cradle takes the J2 DS3225 servo.
5. **Repeat the cradle/horn pattern** for J2 → `arm_upper`,
   J3 → `arm_forearm`, J4 → `gripper_base`.  At each joint a
   `servo_horn_adapter.stl` mediates between the servo's plastic horn
   and the next link's 4-bolt hub.
6. **Press `wrist_adapter.stl`** into the forearm's foot socket bore
   (FOOT_HUB_OD = 12 mm friction fit; you can secure it with a tiny
   drop of CA glue or by drilling a 1 mm cross-pin through the
   socket).
7. **Bolt `gripper_base.stl`** to the underside of the wrist adapter
   using its 4 horn-PCD M3 holes (engaged with the J4 horn adapter
   on the gripper side).  When J4 actuates, the entire gripper base
   pivots about the wrist axis relative to the (forearm-fixed) wrist
   adapter.
8. **Install J5 (MG90S)** in the gripper-base cavity from the +X side
   (output shaft exits the +Y face).  Two M2 / M2.5 self-tappers per
   side fix it to the gripper-base pilots.
9. **Pivot in the two jaws** on a single M2.5 cross-pin through the
   front of the gripper base.  Two small 1.5 mm steel link rods + M2
   pins connect each jaw's pivot lever to the J5 horn, forming the
   parallel-jaw 4-bar.

## Print order + filament estimate

Recommended print order (small to large; lets you debug the
smaller parts before committing to longer prints):

1. `gripper_jaw_left.stl`, `gripper_jaw_right.stl`  (~ 5 g each, 20 min)
2. `wrist_adapter.stl`                              (~ 7 g, 30 min)
3. `gripper_base.stl`                               (~ 28 g, 1 h 45 min)
4. `arm_base_bracket.stl`                           (~ 32 g, 2 h 00 min)
5. `arm_shoulder_link.stl`                          (~ 38 g, 2 h 15 min)
6. `arm_upper.stl`                                  (~ 48 g, 2 h 30 min)
7. `arm_forearm.stl`                                (~ 36 g, 2 h 10 min)

Total: ~ **200 g of PLA / PETG** + ~ 11 hours of print time on an
Ender 3 / Bambu P1S-class FDM machine at 0.2 mm layer height.

Estimated mass of the assembled arm including all servos + hardware:
**~ 560 g** (4 × DS3225 ~ 60 g each = 240 g, 1 × MG90S = 9 g, ~ 200 g
of printed plastic, ~ 100 g of M3 hardware + cabling).

## Wiring / electronics notes

The arm adds **5 servos** (4 × DS3225 + 1 × MG90S) to the 18 already
on the legs, for a total of **23 PWM channels**.  Two PCA9685 boards
(16 channels each) cover this with room to spare — the arm's 5
channels typically go on the SECOND PCA9685 (the first is fully
booked by the legs).

Power:

* J1 - J4 (DS3225 ×4):  ~ 2.5 A average / ~ 8 A stall — same 5-7.4 V
  rail as the leg servos.
* J5 (MG90S):           ~ 0.2 A average — can share the rail or run
  off the Arduino's 5 V if you don't draw too much elsewhere.
* Add ~ 2 A to your existing power budget; an extra 3S 2200 mAh
  pack in parallel covers it.

I²C: the second PCA9685 lives at a different I²C address (default
0x40 vs 0x41 — change one board's address jumper) and daisy-chains
off the first via the I²C pass-through pads.

A starter Arduino sketch that exposes J1-J5 over the same serial
protocol as the legs (`A1+45 J2-10 ... \n`) lives in
`prototype/firmware/prototype_servo_bridge/` — extend the channel
map to include the arm's PCA9685 outputs.

## Workspace

* Maximum 2D reach from J1 axis to gripper tip: **~ 267 mm**
* Reach DOWN below chassis level: with J2 = -90° (shoulder hanging
  straight down) and J3 = J4 = 0° the gripper tip drops ~ 240 mm
  below the chassis top, well past the standing height (~ 117 mm)
  so the gripper can grasp objects on the floor when the hexapod
  is in stance.
* Neutral pose tip: (+129, 0, +5) mm from chassis centre — gripper
  hovers just past the chassis edge at chassis-top elevation.
