"""Shared color + role registry for the hexapod-walker prototype.

Both the PyVista build inspector (``inspect_build.py``) and the MuJoCo
viewer (``mujoco_prototype.py``) import from this module so a part type
is rendered with the *same* color in either tool.  One color per part
*type*, NOT per leg -- e.g. all six ``coxa_link`` instances share the
same green, regardless of which leg they live on.

Design choices
--------------
* The palette is a hand-tuned variant of matplotlib's ``tab10`` /
  ``tab20`` ordering.  Each printable part type gets one of the
  visually distinct hues; the two chassis plates use two related blues
  so they're obviously a pair but still individually identifiable.
* Servo proxies (``servo_body``, ``servo_horn``) are deliberately muted
  near-grays.  The printed parts are the "interesting" geometry an
  assembler looks at; the servos are hardware-store commodities and
  shouldn't compete for attention.
* The palette is fixed.  We do NOT randomize per run -- a part-type
  hue is meant to become muscle memory.

This module imports *only* the standard library so it can be imported
without pulling in trimesh / pyvista / mujoco / numpy.  That keeps the
import graph cheap for both visualization tools and any future CLI
that just wants the color table.
