"""Material properties for the 3D-printed parts.

Everything is in **SI base units inside the solver / report code**:

* Young's modulus E :  Pa     (= N/m^2)
* Yield strength   :  Pa
* Density          :  kg/m^3
* Poisson's ratio  :  dimensionless

We keep both an isotropic-equivalent block (used for the linear-static
CalculiX deck and the beam-bending check) and the orthotropic stack
(printer-Z is weaker than XY for FDM; the XY/Z drop is sourced from
the manufacturer's tensile-test datasheet for the named filament).

The numbers below are the "as-printed, 100 %-infill, no annealing,
no fiber-aligned" values you'd expect from a hobby printer running
the manufacturer's recommended slicer profile.  Two derating knobs
are applied **at the report layer**, not here:

* ``infill_factor`` -- the structural parts in this build are sliced
  at 25 % gyroid, 4 walls.  Effective stiffness/strength on a flat
  spar with that profile is ~ 60-70 % of the solid value; the
  report bakes that into the safety-factor calculation.
* ``brittleness_factor`` -- PLA breaks rather than yields, so we
  derate its effective yield by 1.5x (Polymaker / Prusa application
  note recommendation) when comparing peak von Mises against the
  yield column.

If you want to test "what if I anneal the PLA", "what if I switch
to 80 % infill", or "what if I align fiber along the spar long
axis" you should edit the call sites (``load_cases.py`` for infill;
``report.py`` for brittleness) -- this file is the raw datasheet,
not the as-built property.

Sources (per material, inline in the dict)
------------------------------------------
PLA   -- Polymaker PolyLite PLA Technical Data Sheet rev 2024-09;
         Prusament PLA TDS rev 2025-03.  Both cite ISO 527 dog-bones
         printed on a 0.4 mm nozzle at 100 % infill.  E_XY ~ 2.6 GPa,
         yield ~ 50 MPa, density 1.24 g/cm^3.  Z drop ~ 60 % (so
         E_Z ~ 1.6 GPa, sigma_y,Z ~ 30 MPa).

PETG  -- Polymaker PolyLite PETG TDS rev 2024-09; Bambu Generic PETG
         profile measurements (Bambu test print 2025-06 batch).
         E_XY ~ 1.9 GPa, yield ~ 45 MPa, density 1.27 g/cm^3.  Z
         drop ~ 50 % at the layer interface (PETG bonds better than
         PLA between layers, so the orthotropy is gentler).

PA-CF / Onyx -- Markforged Onyx datasheet rev 2024-05 (chopped-CF
         filled nylon).  E_XY ~ 2.4 GPa, yield (interpreted as the
         flexural stress at 1 % strain) ~ 36 MPa, density
         1.20 g/cm^3.  This is the "Onyx alone" number -- the
         Markforged Mark Two with continuous CF reinforcement would
         be in a different class entirely (E ~ 40-50 GPa on the
         fibered axis); we do NOT model that here.

ABS   -- Bambu Generic ABS TDS rev 2024-11; SD3D / MatterHackers
         university comparison tests, U. of Tennessee Knoxville
         (Roberson et al. 2017, J. Mater. Eng. Perform.).  E_XY ~
         2.0 GPa, yield ~ 30 MPa, density 1.04 g/cm^3.  Z drop
         ~ 55 %.  ABS is the WEAKEST of the four bulk values but
         remains in scope because the prototype's TPU foot pad
         (separate material) is not in this list.

TPU 95A (foot pad) is intentionally absent.  TPU at 95A shore is so
flexible (E ~ 30 MPa) that any of the FEA cases below would print
"deflection > 10 mm, peak stress << 1 MPa", which is not actionable
strength data -- it's a *spring*.  The foot pad is checked by the
foam-pad / impact load case using PETG / PLA as the surrogate
material; if the user prints it in TPU the result is "intentionally
compliant" rather than "fails".

Notes on the orthotropic block
------------------------------
The full orthotropic Young's-modulus tensor for FDM has E_X = E_Y
(in-plane isotropic to first order; printed perimeters dominate
the spar stiffness) and a SEPARATE E_Z (layer-interface bond,
weaker by 40-60 %).  For the LINEAR-STATIC CalculiX deck we lower
the isotropic E to the geometric mean of E_XY and E_Z, which is
correct for parts loaded in primarily out-of-plane bending
(femur spar bent about its long axis sees both XY tension and Z
shear on its layer faces).  See ``isotropic_equivalent`` below
for the math.
